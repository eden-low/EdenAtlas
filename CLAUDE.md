## What this is

A static, 20-page HTML personal system — rebranded **EdenAtlas** in v2.5 ("a personal digital atlas for memories, growth, career, and life"), originally built for Low Fang Jun ("Jun," who remains the site's one Owner and sole personal identity — see the Career CMS bullet below) — now a genuine **multi-tenant** app: the owner and any number of approved "friends" each get their own private expenses/journal/photos/timeline/habits space, isolated by Firebase Auth `uid`. Styled as a dark glassmorphism "system dashboard" (near-black canvas, translucent blurred cards, one soft violet accent, Apple system fonts). No build tools, no JS framework, no package.json — just plain HTML/CSS files opened directly in a browser or served statically. The whole site is **login-first**: every page requires Google sign-in via `login.html` before it renders (see Architecture below) — there is no public, unauthenticated page. Firebase (Auth/Firestore, and Storage for gallery/journal) is loaded via ES module imports straight from `gstatic.com`, and the homepage additionally calls the OpenWeatherMap REST API and the browser Geolocation API — still buildless: no npm, no bundler. The site is installable as a PWA (`manifest.json` + `service-worker.js`, real `images/icon-192.png`/`icon-512.png` app icons).

**Design history**: the site went through two earlier looks — first a neon-purple "Solo Leveling hunter status" theme, then a copy-only cleanup that reworded RPG terms into professional ones (`resume.html`'s section `id`s still carry the old short names). A later pass replaced the *visual* language too: neon glow → glass blur, hot magenta → soft violet, Orbitron/Fira Code webfonts → system UI/monospace, grid-paper background → soft ambient radial glow. The site was then converted from a public portfolio into a login-first personal system (auth gate, `login.html`, `settings.html`, login-history logging, light-mode toggle, PWA scaffolding). "Personal OS v1.2" layered on real PWA icons, Export & Backup, a Habit Tracker, gallery social features (likes/comments/view analytics), and a Notification Center — at that point still single-owner-writes-everything, with viewers granted read access to the owner's private content via an `allowedUsers` whitelist.

**"Personal OS v2.0/v2.1"** rebuilt the write model from the ground up: every content collection is now `uid`-scoped and multi-tenant rather than owner-only, a role system (Owner / Friend / Viewer) replaced the old binary allowed/not-allowed model, `allowedUsers` was renamed to `friends`, and two new pages (`calendar.html`, `reports.html`) were added.

**"Personal OS v3.0"** added [ai.html](ai.html) / [ai-agent.js](ai-agent.js) — a chat interface backed by Google's Gemini API (`@google/genai`, loaded via jsDelivr's `+esm` ESM CDN build) with native function calling: the model can call an `addExpense` tool that writes straight into the same `expenses` collection every other page uses. See the Architecture bullets below for specifics — this section intentionally doesn't re-describe every prior version's details once superseded.

**"Personal OS v3.1"** reworked Dashboard's **Search People**: clicking a result used to expand an inline stats-and-recent-activity card on `dashboard.html` itself, which read as "you just jumped into someone else's home/gallery" — it now navigates to a dedicated read-only page, [profile.html](profile.html) / [profile.js](profile.js) (`?uid=...`), an IG-style profile with a public photo grid you can like/comment on but never edit. This also added the piece Search People was missing to be usable at all: an optional, unique **@username** (set in Settings → Profile) so people can be found by handle instead of relying on email or a possibly-duplicate display name, backed by a new `usernames/{username}` reservation collection. Alongside it, `users/{uid}` gained a public `role` field (owner/friend/viewer, refreshed on every login) so Search People and `profile.html` can enforce the asymmetric visibility the owner wanted: a Viewer's search only ever surfaces the Owner, while a Friend's (or the Owner's) also surfaces every Friend. Expenses stayed exactly as they were — always private, no visibility field — that part of the architecture was deliberately left alone.

**"Personal OS v4.0"** (most recent) is a product-feel pass — "a collection of tools" → "a digital life platform" — with **no new nav pages**. [index.html](index.html) went from a dashboard layout to a daily-habit landing page: greeting/live-clock/weather, a **Today** strip (habits/spending/journal/photos/notifications), an **On This Day** Memories flashback (own past photos/journal/timeline entries matching today's month+day in a prior year), **Recent Memories**, a **This Month** recap, and **Quick Actions** that write straight into `expenses`/`journals`/`photos` via inline modals (not new pages, not the full per-page forms). [profile.html](profile.html)/[profile.js](profile.js) gained GitHub+Instagram-style depth: **bio**/**location**/**joined date** on the header, a **habit completion %** stat, public photo **Albums**, public **Achievement** badges, a public **Timeline**/**Journal** list, and a **Recent Activity** feed — still public-content-only, still no edit affordance anywhere. A new shared module, [global-search.js](global-search.js), adds a site-wide `Ctrl/Cmd-K` **Search Everything** command palette (People/Gallery/Journal/Timeline/Habits/Expenses, grouped results, each linking to the relevant existing page) — the second sanctioned exception to "no shared files besides `scripts.js`," following `auth-guard.js`'s precedent of self-injecting its own DOM (trigger button + modal) rather than requiring per-page markup. Gallery's `category` field was relabeled into **Albums** (`travel`/`projects`/`events`/`dailylife`, displayed as Travel/Projects/Events/Daily Life), with a new independent `featured` boolean making **Favorites** a 5th, cross-cutting album rather than a 5th mutually-exclusive category — existing photos' old category values (`personal`/`event`/`work`/`project`) are aliased into the new taxonomy client-side via `LEGACY_CATEGORY_ALIAS`, never migrated in Firestore. Dashboard gained **Goals** (title/target/current/unit/deadline, a new `goals/{goalId}` collection, always private and shaped exactly like `expenses`) and **Achievements** (tiered badges for Photos Uploaded/Journal Entries/Expenses Recorded/Longest Active Habit Streak, 100% computed from live counts — no hardcoded personal-history milestones, since nothing in the app tracks structured life-event dates to derive them from); Profile shows only the achievement badges derivable from public data (the expenses-based badge never appears on anyone else's profile, since expenses are always private). `users/{uid}` gained `bio`/`location` (editable from Settings, same merge pattern as `username`) and a `createdAt` set only on first login (so "joined" date is stable). Finally, a sitewide copy/icon pass removed the remaining RPG/cyberpunk residue: the "DEVELOPER MODE: ACTIVE" pill is gone, `fa-shield-halved` → `fa-circle-user`, "SYSTEM PROFILE" → "PERSONAL OS".

**"EdenAtlas v2.5 Professional Edition"** — bilingual i18n, an HR-friendly Career
CMS, mobile-first navigation, a documented design system, and a full rebrand, with **no new nav
pages and no file renames** (only user-facing labels changed, to avoid a risky site-wide route
rename). Four things, in order of how deep they cut:
1. **i18n** — [js/i18n.js](js/i18n.js) is a **third** sanctioned shared module (after
   `auth-guard.js`/`global-search.js`), loaded first on every page. [locales/en.json](locales/en.json)/[locales/zh-CN.json](locales/zh-CN.json)
   hold `data-i18n`-keyed UI strings; `users/{uid}` gained an optional public `lang` field
   (same merge-write pattern as `bio`/`username`), reconciled against `localStorage["eden:lang"]`
   once auth resolves. Career's bilingual **content** fields (`title_en`/`title_zh`, etc.) are a
   separate mechanism — `career.js` re-renders on an `eden:langchange` event `i18n.js` dispatches,
   rather than going through `data-i18n`.
2. **Career CMS** — `resume.html` (nav-labeled "Career") gained four new Firestore collections
   (`career_experiences`, `career_projects`, `career_certificates`, `career_awards`), each
   `{uid, visibility, createdAt, updatedAt, ...bilingual fields}`. Unlike every other collection,
   Career is **Owner-only to write** (`isOwner()`, not `canParticipate()`) — the page has always
   been about one person, not a per-uid space — so Friends/Viewers/HR only ever read public
   items. `career.js` reuses the mine+public merge pattern (the "mine" half only ever returns
   anything for the Owner). Profile/Highlights(renamed from Matrix)/Education/Leadership stayed
   static prose (out of CMS scope); Work Experience → **Experience**, the old achievement cards
   → **Certificates**/**Awards**, and **Projects** is wholly new (Featured strip, category
   filter, detail modal, a Reflection field). [migrate-career.html](migrate-career.html) is a
   one-time, manually-run, unlinked/unguarded page that ports the old static content into the
   new collections — delete it after running once.
3. **Mobile navigation** — [js/mobile-nav.js](js/mobile-nav.js), a **fourth** shared module.
   Every page's `<header>` gained `hidden md:block`; below `md`, this module injects a fixed top
   bar, a slide-in drawer, a fixed bottom nav, and a Quick Add bottom sheet that deep-links to
   `{page}.html?new=1` — `expenses.js`/`journal.js`/`gallery.js`/`timeline.js`/`habits.js` each
   got a small `maybeAutoOpenFromQuickAdd()` addition that auto-opens their existing "New X"
   modal when that param is present and `canParticipate()` is true (never a duplicated form).
4. **Brand & nav cleanup** — "LOW FANG JUN / PERSONAL OS" → "EdenAtlas" (title tags,
   `manifest.json`, footer `EdenAtlas · by Jun · Version 2.5`) and nav *labels* only (file names
   untouched): Gallery→Memories, Timeline→Journey, Expenses→Finance, Notifications→Inbox,
   Resume→Career, Dashboard→People. See [design-system.md](design-system.md) for the full visual
   language, including the "don't reintroduce this vocabulary" list.

**"EdenAtlas v2.6" (most recent)** is a Product Design Phase — no new features, no database
changes, no broken auth — aimed purely at making the product feel calmer and more premium:
1. **AI removed entirely.** [ai.html](ai.html)/`ai-agent.js` are deleted; the nav-link line was
   stripped from every remaining page via the usual scripted sitewide pass; `service-worker.js`'s
   `PRECACHE`/`BYPASS_HOSTS` and the AI-related README/CLAUDE.md sections were cleaned up too
   (the v3.0/v3.1 history paragraphs above are left as an accurate historical record, per this
   file's own convention — only *current-state* descriptions were removed).
2. **Desktop sidebar** — [js/sidebar.js](js/sidebar.js), a **fifth** sanctioned shared module.
   The old horizontal top-nav `<header>` is now `class="hidden"` on every breakpoint everywhere
   (sitewide scripted pass, markup left in place rather than deleted — same low-risk "hide, don't
   restructure" approach used for the header in v2.5). In its place, `sidebar.js` injects a fixed
   left `<aside>` (desktop-only, `hidden md:flex`) with the primary nav list, a smaller secondary
   group (Habits/Contact — pages the brief's sidebar list didn't mention but which still need a
   way to be reached, mirroring how `mobile-nav.js`'s drawer already omits them from its primary
   set), and a bottom-pinned Profile/Logout/Collapse block. Collapse state
   (`localStorage["eden:sidebarCollapsed"]`) toggles a `--sidebar-w` CSS custom property that
   `body`'s `padding-left` reads (`styles.css`), so every page reflows without a per-page layout
   change — the same trick `mobile-nav.js` already used for its own top/bottom padding.
3. **Home recomposed, not just reordered** — `index.html`'s five separate "Today" mini-cards
   collapsed into one **Today's Overview** card with internal rows; a new **Continue Working**
   section lists today's not-yet-checked-off habits (derived from data already fetched, no new
   collection); **Quick Actions** went from three cards to one row of pills. The existing "On
   This Day" Memories flashback and Recent Memories sections were kept (the brief's requested
   order didn't mention them, but nothing asked for their removal either).
4. **Career de-portfolio'd** — the `#matrix` Highlights section (leadership radar/donut charts)
   is deleted outright, including its Chart.js `<canvas>`/init script and the `chart.js` CDN
   `<script>` tag (no longer used anywhere on the page). Education is folded into a slimmed
   Profile header (photo/bio/contact/degree, no progress bars or percentages); Leadership &
   Events survives as a compact icon+title+date list, not per-item paragraphs. `career.js`'s
   `projectCard()` gained a cover image (first `project.images` entry, or a placeholder icon) and
   an explicit "View Details" affordance; the detail modal was reorganized into labeled
   Overview/Gallery/Documents/Reflection/Links sections (each hidden if empty). A **Download CV**
   button calls `window.print()`, paired with an `@media print` rule in `styles.css` that hides
   all chrome and prints the page's own content — no new file, no stored PDF asset.
5. **Icons: Lucide added, not swapped in.** Every page's `<head>` now also loads Lucide's CDN
   script alongside Font Awesome. Rather than risk an unverifiable full swap of ~327 existing
   Font Awesome references (several generated dynamically, each needing its own
   `lucide.createIcons()` re-render call), Lucide is used only on this pass's redesigned surfaces
   (sidebar, Home, Career, Profile) — see `design-system.md`'s icon-rules section for the exact
   "static vs. dynamically-rendered" re-render caveat.
6. **Empty states rewritten** with warmer copy in both locale files (Journal/Memories/Career/
   Habits per the brief, extended to Finance/Journey/Inbox for consistency) — the static HTML
   fallback text was updated to match, not just the `data-i18n` translation.
7. **Restrained animation**: a body-level fade-in tied to the existing `auth-check-pending`
   class removal (no HTML changes — `auth-guard.js` already toggles that class); an opt-in
   `.card-lift` class (not baked into `.neon-border-purple` itself, which is also used on
   non-card surfaces like the sticky sub-nav and modal panels, where a hover lift would look like
   a glitch); a generic `.fixed.inset-0.z-50 > .relative` fade+pop entrance that covers every
   modal in the app with zero per-modal HTML changes; and a `.skeleton` shimmer utility applied
   to Profile's header and Career's Experience list while their initial fetch is in flight.

**"EdenAtlas v2.7" (most recent)** is "Collections & Atlas" — the first pass that connects
existing record types instead of adding a new type of record. No new nav pages besides Atlas and
the Me merge; Collections deliberately has no sidebar/drawer entry of its own.
1. **Collections** — a new `collections/{id}` Firestore collection (`{uid, title_en/zh,
   description_en/zh, coverImageUrl, icon, color, notes, visibility, createdAt, updatedAt}`,
   same `isMineOrPublic` rule shape as `journals`/`life_events`/`habits`) plus an optional
   `collectionId` field on `photos`/`journals`/`life_events`/`expenses`/`career_projects` —
   containers/filters, never a data migration: old docs simply read as `collectionId: null`.
   [collections.html](collections.html)/[collections.js](collections.js) lists mine+public
   collections plus a synthetic "Uncategorized" card (per-type item counts computed by fetching
   each type's mine+public/mine-only arrays once and filtering client-side, never a
   `where("collectionId","==",id)` query alone — this codebase's index/rules-avoidance
   convention, see the query-pattern bullet below); delete is **blocked** (not just confirmed)
   while any item still references it. Cover images are a plain URL string, either typed or
   copied from one of the user's own Memories — never a Storage upload, so `storage.rules`
   needed no changes at all. [collection-detail.html](collection-detail.html)/
   [collection-detail.js](collection-detail.js) (`?id=` or the virtual `?id=uncategorized`)
   renders one section per record type (Finance only for the collection's own owner, regardless
   of the collection's visibility) plus an owner-editable Reflection/Notes field, with warm
   per-section empty-state copy.
2. **Edit-metadata** — gallery/journal/expenses/timeline/career.js each gained an edit modal
   following `career.js`'s pre-existing `open*Form(id)` + id-branching-submit +
   `wireOwnerControls` pattern (the only prior art for this in the codebase), gated by
   `item.uid === auth.currentUser.uid` instead of `isOwner()` since these are participant-owned
   records, not the Owner-only Career CMS. Every edit sets `updatedAt: serverTimestamp()`,
   never touches the original `createdAt`/`uploadedAt`. Gallery also gained **bulk move**: a
   "Select" mode toggling a checkbox overlay on the signed-in user's own post cards, plus a
   floating action bar that reassigns every selected post's `collectionId` in one `Promise.all`.
3. **Atlas** — [atlas.html](atlas.html)/[atlas.js](atlas.js), a Leaflet.js map (CARTO
   dark/light-tiles CDN, no paid API, no marker-icon asset — pins are `L.divIcon` colored dots
   to sidestep Leaflet's default-icon path issue on a CDN-only setup) of every
   `locationName`/`latitude`/`longitude` a Memory/Journal entry/Journey event carries (Finance
   and Career intentionally never get a location UI). Two segmented tabs: **My Atlas** (default,
   own data only, any visibility, exact coordinates — same personal-only shape as
   Calendar/Reports) and **Connections** (lazy-fetched only the first time that tab opens;
   public-only records from the owner + approved friends via the same role gate as Search
   People/`profile.js`; capped to the 100 most recent; coordinates rounded to ~2 decimals; never
   queries `expenses`, ever, by construction). Clicking a pin/list item opens a detail panel
   (location name, per-type counts, linked Collections, a few recent photos). A "Collections"
   tab at the top of Atlas is a plain link to `collections.html` — the only nav entry point into
   Collections anywhere in the app. The Memories/Journal/Journey create-and-edit forms gained a
   location input (`locationName` text + optional lat/lng + a "Use current location" button that
   copies `index.html`'s existing promise-wrapped Geolocation pattern verbatim).
4. **Me** — [me.html](me.html)/[me.js](me.js) merges Profile-viewing-yourself + Settings +
   Dashboard's personal-analytics half into one tabbed page (Overview/Profile/Preferences/
   Privacy/Connections/Backup/System Logs), reusing every underlying function unchanged (just
   relocated) rather than reimplementing any of it. `dashboard.html`/`dashboard.js` (nav-labeled
   **Connections**, was People) is trimmed to just Search People. `settings.html` is now a
   one-line `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=me.html">` redirect, kept only so old
   bookmarks/links don't 404. Privacy is deliberately minimal (an explainer + a read-only echo of
   the existing default-visibility preference) rather than inventing new profile-visibility
   toggles nothing else in the app would read.
5. **Nav** — `sidebar.js`'s `PRIMARY_LINKS` becomes Home/Career/Memories/**Atlas**/Journal/
   Finance/Calendar/**Connections**(relabel)/Reports/Inbox; Journey moves into `SECONDARY_LINKS`
   (Atlas is now the larger location/chapter module); the bottom "Profile→Settings" row becomes
   "**Me**→me.html". `mobile-nav.js` mirrors this (`DRAWER_LINKS` gains Atlas, its `settings.html`
   entries become `me.html`) and gets one new Quick Add item, "New Collection" →
   `collections.html?new=1`. i18n keys: `nav.atlas`/`nav.me`/`nav.collections`, new `atlas.*`/
   `collections.*`/`me.*` namespaces, `common.tags`/`location`/`collection`/`uncategorized`/
   `edit_metadata`/`move_to_collection`/`use_current_location`, and `nav.people`/
   `mobilenav.people`'s English *value* changed to "Connections" (Chinese "人脉" already read that
   way, so it was left as-is) — labels only, no key renames, no file renames.

**"EdenAtlas v2.8" — "Polish · Identity · Experience"** is a UX-only pass: no new
pages, no Firestore/Storage schema changes, no rules changes. Four surfaces were touched:
1. **Login** — `login.html` was rebuilt around one centered card (EA mark, "EdenAtlas," a
   tagline, a rounded-full "Continue with Google" button, a small privacy line) over a new
   `.login-bg`/`.login-dot-grid`/`.login-orbit-ring` texture (`styles.css`) — a dark gradient
   plus an almost-invisible dot grid and a few hairline concentric rings, deliberately far short
   of the old build's neon-glow register. A stacked footer (`EdenAtlas` / `Built by Jun` /
   `Version 2.8`) replaced the single-line footer, on this page only — see the Brand &
   navigation bullet below for why the version bump didn't go sitewide. Post-sign-in, both the
   session-restore and fresh-sign-in paths now call a `transitionToApp()` helper that fades the
   card out, fades a small pulsing EA mark in, and only then navigates — replacing an instant
   `location.href` jump. New i18n keys: `login.tagline`/`login.continue_google`/`login.privacy`.
2. **Connections redesign** — `dashboard.html`/`dashboard.js` (nav-labeled "Connections") grew
   from a bare live-search box into an Apple Contacts-style page: a **Search** box that swaps the
   page into a "Search Results" view while non-empty; a default **Recommended Connections**
   strip (the four most-recently-joined people the viewer's role can see, by `users/{uid}.
   createdAt`); **Your Connections** (everyone else that role can see, alphabetical); and a
   static **Connection Requests** placeholder card with no backing data — there is no
   follow/request graph in Firestore, and the brief explicitly called this a future placeholder.
   All three lists share one `personCard()` renderer (avatar/name/@username/bio/location, plus a
   lazily-fetched, cached **public Collections count** — `where("uid","==",p.uid),
   where("visibility","==","public")` against `collections`, the same equality-only query shape
   used everywhere else in this app) ending in an explicit "Open Profile" affordance rather than
   an inline expansion. Skeleton placeholders (`.skeleton`) show in both list containers until
   the `users` directory fetch resolves. New i18n keys under `people.*`
   (`search_results`/`no_search_results`/`recommended`/`recommended_subtitle`/
   `no_recommendations`/`your_connections`/`no_connections`/`requests`/`requests_placeholder`/
   `open_profile`/`subtitle`).
3. **Profile gained Career + Public Atlas** — `profile.js` now also fetches public
   `career_experiences`/`career_projects` for the viewed `uid` (same `fetchPublicFor()` shape as
   every other section; in practice usually only non-empty on the Owner's own profile, since
   Career stays Owner-only to write) and renders a compact, date-sorted **Career** section
   (`#career-section`, hidden if empty). **Public Atlas** (`#atlas-section`) is a tag list of
   distinct `locationName` values pulled from the profile's already-fetched public
   photos/journals/life_events, each with an occurrence count, plus a "View on Atlas" link to
   `atlas.html` — a deliberate choice *not* to re-embed Leaflet on every profile view (Atlas
   itself remains the one page that owns the map). `profile-content`'s section order was
   reshuffled to roughly follow the brief's Profile → Career → Public Memories → Public Atlas →
   Journey → Achievements sequence (Recent Activity and Public Journal, not named in the brief,
   were kept and placed after).
4. **Language consolidated, not changed** — auditing every page confirmed the language switcher
   already lived in exactly the two places the brief allows on mobile/Me (Me → Preferences'
   `.lang-choice-btn` row, the mobile drawer's `.drawer-lang-btn` footer row) and nowhere else;
   the one gap was the desktop sidebar, which had no language control at all. `js/sidebar.js`
   gained an `.eden-sidebar-lang-row` (EN/中文 pills) in its bottom-pinned footer block, wired to
   the same `getLang()`/`setLang()`/`eden:langchange` triad every other switcher uses — still one
   global language state, now genuinely three (not more) surfaces. The row is hidden via CSS
   when the sidebar is collapsed, matching how `.eden-sidebar-label` text already disappears in
   that state.
5. **Loading & empty states** — a new sitewide `html::before` rule in `styles.css` paints a
   small pulsing EA mark behind every page, invisible in normal use (the opaque `body` covers it)
   but visible through `body.auth-check-pending`'s `opacity:0` during the brief window before
   `auth-guard.js` resolves — since CSS opacity collapses an element's entire subtree as one
   composited group, a *descendant* of body could never un-hide itself this way, so the mark had
   to be painted on `html` instead, behind body rather than inside it. Warmer empty-state copy
   landed in `locales/*.json` (+ each page's static HTML fallback) for Connections
   (`people.no_connections`), Career Projects (`career.no_projects`), Collections
   (`collections.no_collections`), and Atlas (`atlas.no_locations`), per the brief's exact
   wording. `atlas.js`'s one remaining raw `"Loading..."` string was normalized to the
   `"Loading…"` convention used everywhere else.
6. **Brand & navigation**: no nav changes (Connections already existed, no new page was added).
   Every page footer was bumped from `Version 2.5` to `Version 2.8` (a straight string swap —
   `login.html`'s footer had already been rebuilt with the new stacked layout earlier in this
   same pass, so this just brought the other 19 pages' single-line footers up to the same
   version number; the `footer.line` locale key, though currently unused by any page's markup,
   was updated to match). No `brand-book.md` exists in this repo — `design-system.md` remained
   the single source of truth for tokens/spacing/motion throughout this pass.

**"EdenAtlas v2.9" — "Living Memories"** finishes sitewide i18n and adds two
always-private emotional-checkpoint features. No AI, no Firebase architecture changes, no schema
changes to any pre-existing collection.
1. **Full i18n completion.** The gap this pass closed: `js/i18n.js`'s `applyTranslations()` was
   only ever called from `init()`/`setLanguage()` (global, whole-`document` passes) — no
   page-level script called it or `t()` at all, so anything rendered by JS after page load
   (list items, modals, status text, empty states, Chart.js labels, category/mood label maps)
   was permanently English regardless of the selected language. Fixed by generalizing the one
   existing precedent, `career.js`'s `bi()` helper + `eden:langchange` listener (previously
   scoped only to Career's bilingual Firestore *content* fields), into a sitewide pattern: every
   page-level script now does `import { t } from "./js/i18n.js"`, wraps UI-chrome strings in
   `t("namespace.key")` *at render time*, and adds a `document.addEventListener("eden:langchange",
   ...)` that re-runs its existing render function(s) against already-cached data — no refetch.
   `collections.js`/`collection-detail.js` already had their own `bi()`/`curLang()` for bilingual
   `title_en`/`title_zh` content but were missing the `eden:langchange` listener (titles never
   updated on a live language switch) and read the pre-fix legacy `localStorage["eden:lang"]`
   key instead of `getLang()` — both fixed. `js/i18n.js` itself gained `t(key, vars)`
   `{placeholder}` interpolation (e.g. `t("time_capsule.locked_notice", { date })`), a fallback
   chain (current language → English dict → raw key), and a `console.warn` on missing keys,
   gated to `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` only. User-generated content (a person's own journal text,
   photo captions, expense notes, etc.) is never passed through `t()` — only UI chrome, category/
   mood label config objects, and static markup already covered by `data-i18n`.
2. **Time Capsule** — [time-capsule.html](time-capsule.html)/[time-capsule.js](time-capsule.js),
   a new page (closest template: `habits.html`/`habits.js`, the simplest single-collection CRUD
   page) backed by a new `time_capsules/{id}` collection: `{uid, title, message, openAt,
   createdAt, updatedAt, status: "sealed"|"opened", visibility: "private", attachmentUrl,
   attachmentType}`. Always private — same owner-uid-only rules shape as `goals`/`expenses`, never
   `isMineOrPublic()`. Three sections (Sealed / Ready to Open / Opened) are a client-side split of
   one `where("uid","==",myUid)` query (this repo's index-avoidance convention): `status===
   "opened"` → Opened; `status==="sealed" && openAt<=now` → Ready to Open; otherwise → Sealed.
   Opening does `updateDoc(..., { status: "opened", updatedAt: serverTimestamp() })`. Optional
   attachment uploads to a new Storage path `capsules/{uid}/...` (always-private, no `/public`
   split — mirrors `career/{uid}/private`'s shape but scoped to the uploader instead of
   Owner-only). Home shows a calm ready-notice card (`#capsule-ready-section`, same hidden-by-
   default pattern as `#memories-section`) once any capsule is due; a best-effort
   `checkCapsuleReadyNotifications()` (copied from `habits.js`'s streak-notification shape,
   deduped via `localStorage`) writes a `notifications` doc (`capsule_ready`, added to
   `notifications.js`'s `TYPE_META`). Nav: a secondary item in `js/sidebar.js`/
   `js/mobile-nav.js` (not primary — the brief explicitly said not to crowd the main sidebar),
   a `mobilenav.new_capsule` Quick Add entry deep-linking `time-capsule.html?new=1` (auto-opens
   the create modal, same `maybeAutoOpenFromQuickAdd()` convention as every other Quick Add
   target), a Home Quick Actions pill, and a compact sealed/ready-count summary card in Me →
   Overview (not a duplicate CRUD UI — just a link out to the real page).
3. **Daily Reflection** — no new page; lives entirely as a card on `index.html` next to Today's
   Overview. New `daily_reflections/{id}` collection, doc ID = `${uid}_${dateKey}` (the app's
   established "deterministic ID for structural uniqueness" trick, same idea as
   `usernames/{username}`) so a same-day re-save is a `setDoc(..., {merge:true})` overwrite, never
   a duplicate, with no query needed to check "does today's entry already exist." Six moods
   (happy/neutral/tired/sad/excited/grateful), one text input, always private — same owner-uid-
   only rules shape as Time Capsule. Reports gained a small summary block (mood count this month,
   most common mood, reflection days) from one `fetchMine("daily_reflections")` call.
4. **Monthly Story & Year in Review** — two new `reports.html` sections, rendered by new
   functions in `insights.js`. Month/year picker copies `calendar.js`'s `viewDate` +
   prev/next-button pattern. Template-based prose only (no AI, no external API) — a fixed
   sentence skeleton per language with an opening qualifier chosen from a small deterministic
   pool based on total activity volume, and clauses that only appear when their stat is > 0 (so
   the paragraph never reads "0 capsules opened this month"). Data sources: `photos`, `journals`,
   `expenses`, `habits`, `collections`, `career_projects` (Owner-only-populated, same as
   elsewhere), `time_capsules`, `daily_reflections` — every query is `where("uid","==",myUid)`
   only, the same personal-only shape as the rest of Reports/Calendar/Me-Overview, so neither
   section can structurally expose another user's data to a Viewer or Friend. Export as Markdown
   reuses `export.js`'s `downloadFile()` shape, duplicated locally in `insights.js` rather than
   imported — importing `export.js` directly was tried first and reverted, since `export.js`'s
   top-level code unconditionally wires click listeners onto Backup-tab buttons (`#export-
   expenses-btn` etc.) that don't exist on `reports.html`, throwing on load; per this repo's
   per-page-duplication convention, the small `downloadFile()` utility now lives in both files
   independently instead of being a shared import with side effects.
5. **Brand & navigation**: every page footer bumped from `Version 2.8` to `Version 2.9`
   (including `login.html`'s stacked-footer variant). No nav *label* changes — Time Capsule is
   the only new nav entry, added as a secondary item per the brief.

**"EdenAtlas v3.0" (most recent) — "Identity & Motion"** is a brand/experience pass — no AI, no
backend, no Firebase architecture or schema changes, no rules changes, no new nav pages. Four
things:
1. **Splash screen** — [js/splash.js](js/splash.js), a sixth sanctioned shared module (after
   `i18n.js`/`auth-guard.js`/`global-search.js`/`mobile-nav.js`/`sidebar.js`), loaded before
   `js/i18n.js` on every protected page (and on `login.html`). While `body.auth-check-pending`
   is present it shows a full-viewport overlay (mark + "EdenAtlas" wordmark + a
   `data-i18n="splash.message"` tagline) appended to `<html>` directly — a sibling of `<body>`,
   not a descendant, for the same reason `styles.css`'s pre-existing `html::before` pulse mark
   (which still fires from the very first paint, zero JS, as an instant fallback) is painted
   there rather than inside body. A `MutationObserver` (not a fixed timer) fades it out the
   moment `auth-check-pending` is removed, with a 6s hard fallback for paths that navigate away
   without ever clearing that class (`login.html`'s session-restore redirect); skips mounting
   entirely if auth already resolved by the time the script runs, so a fast session never gets
   artificially delayed. New i18n keys: `splash.message` ("Opening your atlas…" /
   "正在打开你的数字地图…").
2. **Branded loading states** — a new `common.loading_atlas` i18n key ("Loading your atlas…" /
   "正在整理你的数字地图…") for the rare inline case a skeleton doesn't fit; everywhere else,
   `.skeleton` placeholder blocks (Career's Experience list already had these) were added
   directly into a container's *static* HTML on Memories' feed, Collections' grid, and Time
   Capsule's three sections — shaped roughly like the real content, on screen immediately, wiped
   for free the moment that page's existing `replaceChildren(...)` render call runs. No fetch/
   render logic touched on any page.
3. **Brand motion** — one new `styles.css` rule gives every element already using the sitewide
   `hover:scale-105` button convention a matching `:active { transform: scale(0.97) }` press-
   down (an attribute-substring selector reading the Tailwind utility name out of the class
   attribute, the same trick `html[data-theme="light"]`'s overrides use), so new buttons get
   press feedback for free without a markup change. Everything else the brief asked for
   (page fade-in, card lift, sidebar hover, modal pop, reduced-motion handling) already existed
   from v2.6/v2.8 and needed no change.
4. **Identity docs** — [brand-book.md](brand-book.md) is new: a short, high-level identity doc
   (tagline, voice, logo do's/don'ts, first-impression principles) separate from
   `design-system.md`'s component-level detail, superseding the earlier "no brand-book.md exists"
   note from v2.8. `design-system.md` gained Logo system / Splash screen / Loading states
   sections and a button-press-feedback bullet. The logo itself needed no file changes — audited
   every reference (`login.html`, `js/splash.js`, `js/sidebar.js`, `js/mobile-nav.js`) and all of
   them already pointed at the one canonical `images/logo-mark.png`, just at different sizes per
   context (now tabulated in `design-system.md`); per the brief, PNG was kept as-is rather than
   converted to SVG.
5. **Favicon** — every page gained `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="192x192"
   href="images/icon-192.png">` next to its existing `apple-touch-icon` tag; there was
   previously no favicon link at all sitewide (browsers fell back to a generic/broken tab icon).
   `manifest.json` and `theme-color` were already correct and needed no change.
6. **Brand & navigation**: every page footer bumped from `Version 2.9` (or `2.9.1` on
   `time-capsule.html`, `2.8` on the handful of pages an earlier pass's footer-i18n sweep had
   missed) to `Version 3.0` — the missing `data-i18n="footer.line"` attribute was added to those
   pages at the same time, closing a real i18n gap (their footer previously never translated).
   Login's tagline changed from "Your digital home." to "Your life, beautifully organized." /
   "把生活、回忆与成长，安静地整理在一起。", matching `design-system.md`'s pre-existing "Homepage line."
   Memory Constellation (the brief's optional Task 9) was deliberately skipped given the size of
   the rest of this pass — recommended as a v3.1 candidate rather than risking this one.

**"EdenAtlas v3.2" (most recent) — "Trusted Connections"** turns Connections from a
role-based directory/placeholder into a real, mutual-consent friend graph, and adds a third
`connections` visibility tier alongside private/public. No AI, no backend/Cloud Functions, no
npm — the accept flow is deliberately transaction-free (see below).
1. **Friend graph** — two new top-level collections, `friend_requests/{toUid}/incoming/{fromUid}`
   (`{fromUid, toUid, status: pending|accepted|declined|cancelled, fromDisplayName, fromUsername,
   fromPhotoURL, createdAt, updatedAt}`) and `friendships/{uid}/friends/{friendUid}` — entirely
   separate from the pre-existing owner/friend/viewer `friends/{email}` whitelist role system,
   which is unchanged and still governs `canParticipate()`/CRUD gating. The accept flow needs no
   transaction or cross-uid write: the acceptor writes only their own `friend_requests` doc and
   their own `friendships` mirror; the *other* side's mirror is created lazily by that side's own
   client the next time it loads Connections (`dashboard.js`'s `loadSentRequestsAndHeal()`), and a
   removed friendship is similarly self-pruned by the removed side (`pruneStaleFriendships()`) —
   every write is scoped to the caller's own uid path segment, so `firestore.rules` never needs a
   cross-user write beyond one narrow exception (below). `firestore.rules` gained
   `isAcceptedFriend(ownerUid)` (named differently from the obvious `isFriend(ownerUid)` to avoid
   shadowing the pre-existing whitelist-role `isFriend()`) and `match` blocks for both
   collections enforcing: create-by-`fromUid` only, read-by-either-side, accept/decline only by
   `toUid`, cancel only by `fromUid`, and a friendship doc creatable only when a matching
   `friend_requests` doc is already `accepted` (checked in either direction) — structurally
   preventing anyone from self-adding a friendship. The `notifications` create rule gained one
   narrow cross-uid exception: a sender may write a `friend_request`/`friend_accepted` doc
   directly into the recipient's inbox (self-attested via `fromUid == request.auth.uid`), the only
   type of notification in the app that isn't self-written.
2. **`connections` visibility tier** — `isMineOrPublic()`/`isPhotoMineOrPublic()` gained an OR
   clause, `data.visibility == 'connections' && isAcceptedFriend(data.uid)`, turning this on for
   `journals`/`life_events`/`photos`/`collections` with no other rule changes. Reachable only via
   a two-equality query pinning both `uid` and `visibility` (the same shape as this app's
   pre-existing `fetchPublicFor()`/mine+public pattern) — a bare `visibility=='connections'` query
   with no `uid` filter is rejected by Firestore's query-rule provability check, since
   `isAcceptedFriend(data.uid)` can't be proven for an unconstrained `uid`. This is why
   connections-tier content is only ever fetched per-target-uid (Friend Profile View, one query)
   or per-friend-in-a-loop (Atlas's Connections tab), never as one broad query across all users.
   A third radio option (`value="connections"`, alongside the existing public/private pair) was
   added to every create/edit visibility picker on Memories/Journal/Journey/Collections (+
   `index.html`'s Quick Add journal/photo modals) — **Habits is deliberately excluded**, matching
   the brief's applicability list. `storage.rules` gained matching `gallery/{uid}/connections/`
   and `journal/{uid}/connections/` path rules (uploads already bake `visibility` into the storage
   path, so the third value just needed a third path match) — readable by the owner or anyone in
   their `friendships` subcollection. Finance/Time Capsule/Daily Reflection/Career/System Logs
   stay exactly as private/owner-only as before — never touched.
3. **Connections page redesign** (`dashboard.html`/`dashboard.js`, nav-labeled Connections) — four
   sections: Search People (unchanged discovery, still role-gated by `users/{uid}.role` the same
   way it always was — a Viewer only finds the Owner, a Friend/Owner find each other; that role
   gate is orthogonal to the new friend graph), Friend Requests (real incoming pending requests,
   Accept/Decline), My Friends (renamed from "Your Connections" — now sourced from real accepted
   friendships instead of the whole role-visible directory), and Sent Requests (pending requests
   I've sent — computed by looping the already-fetched `users` directory and doing one cached
   `getDoc` per candidate against their `friend_requests/{them}/incoming/{me}`, the same
   personal-app-scale lazy-per-card pattern `publicCollectionsCount()` already used — no new
   collection or collection-group query needed). The old static "Connection Requests" placeholder
   card is gone. Person cards never render email, matching the pre-existing
   `publicDisplayName()`/`formatHandle()` convention.
4. **Notifications reach every user, not just the owner** — `notifications.js`'s
   `fetchNotifications()` and `auth-guard.js`'s unread badge both used to gate on `isOwner(user)`,
   a pre-existing gap (not a v3.2 decision) that predates this pass: `firestore.rules` and
   `login.html`'s own comments already treated notifications as per-user, but the client never
   caught up. Both gates now simply require "signed in," since friend-request notifications must
   reach non-owner recipients. `TYPE_META` gained `friend_request`/`friend_accepted`, and
   `notifCard()` links those two types to `dashboard.html`.
5. **Friend Profile View** — `profile.js`'s `fetchPublicFor()` became `fetchVisibleFor()`, which
   also runs the connections-tier query (scoped to the target uid) when a new
   `isAcceptedFriendOfTarget()` check (one `getDoc` on the target's own `friendships` subcollection
   — readable by either side per the rule above) is true, merged with public by doc id. Applies to
   Memories/Journal/Journey; Habits stays public-only (unchanged); Career/Achievements/Recent
   Activity/Atlas-places sections are untouched code-wise and just inherit the richer merged
   arrays. **`profile.html` deliberately stays single-scroll**, not rebuilt into the brief's
   suggested 4-tab layout — a scope decision made with the user up front to avoid a much larger,
   riskier rewrite of a page that already works; only the data shown changed. Atlas's Connections
   tab (`atlas.js`) keeps its existing role-based public aggregation unchanged and layers on a
   second pass: one connections-tier query per uid in the viewer's real friendships set, merged
   into the same cluster set.
6. **Friend-mode navigation** — `js/sidebar.js` and `js/mobile-nav.js` now render a shorter,
   flattened link set (Home/Memories/Atlas/Journal/Calendar/Connections/Inbox/Habits) for any
   non-owner (Friend or Viewer alike), dropping Career/Finance/Reports/Time Capsule/Constellation
   from nav entirely — those pages aren't deleted, just no longer linked, and mobile's Quick Add
   sheet drops the Add Expense/New Capsule entries the same way. `auth-guard.js` gained a second
   responsibility as the direct-URL backstop: any page opting in via `<body data-owner-only="true">`
   (`expenses.html`, `reports.html`, `time-capsule.html`, `constellation.html` — **not**
   `resume.html`, which dropped this attribute in v3.2.2, see below)
   redirects a non-owner to `index.html?notice=private_space`, which shows a small dismissible
   "This space is private." notice and strips the query param via `history.replaceState`.
7. **i18n**: new keys under `people.*` (`add_friend`, `friend`, `friends`, `friend_requests`,
   `incoming_requests`, `sent_requests`, `remove_friend`, `pending`, `request_sent`,
   `request_accepted`, plus `my_friends` replacing `your_connections`) and `common.*` (`accept`,
   `decline`, `connections` — the third visibility label, "好友可见" in Chinese per the brief —
   and `this_space_is_private`). Friend-request/accepted notification title/message text is
   written in plain English at write time, matching the pre-existing `login.html` "New login
   detected" convention (notifications were never localized at write time anywhere in this app,
   not a new gap introduced here).
8. **Brand & navigation**: every page footer bumped to `Version 3.2`.

**"EdenAtlas v3.2.2" (most recent) — "Public Career Profile / Resume Access"** fixes a real bug
(`resume.html` carried `data-owner-only="true"`, so `auth-guard.js` bounced every Friend/Viewer
away from Career before they could see anything — public/connections-tier career items were
structurally unreachable by anyone but the Owner) and, on top of that fix, opens a genuine
unauthenticated HR path. No new nav pages, no chat/feed/comments/likes, no change to Trusted
Connections, no mobile-shell changes.
1. **Root-cause fix** — `resume.html`'s `<body>` dropped `data-owner-only="true"` for
   `data-public-optional="true"` (a new, opt-in `auth-guard.js` attribute: on sign-out, instead of
   redirecting to `login.html`, it just reveals the page — the page itself is responsible for only
   rendering what its own read rules allow an anonymous request to see). This alone restores
   Friend/Viewer access to Career, which had regressed to Owner-only-reachable despite the
   underlying `isMineOrPublic()` read rule always having supported public/connections items.
2. **Page-level `careerVisibility`** — `users/{uid}` gained an optional `careerVisibility`
   (`"private"|"connections"|"public"`, missing == `"private"`), editable only by the Owner from
   a new "Public Resume Link" card at the top of `resume.html` (`career.js`), merge-written to
   both `users/{uid}` and the new `public_profiles/{uid}` mirror (below). This is a **client-side,
   UI-level gate** — the same tier as `profile.html`'s pre-existing `canViewProfile()` — deciding
   whether `resume.html` bothers rendering anything for this viewer at all; it does not change
   what firestore.rules itself allows a direct query to return (see next point). The very first
   time the Owner loads their own resume with this field never set, it's auto-upgraded to
   `"public"` once (mirrors `login.html`'s "only write `createdAt` on first login" pattern) — the
   app historically treated Career as a public portfolio, so this restores that default without
   changing the rules-level default (which stays the safer `"private"`).
3. **Unauthenticated public reads** — `firestore.rules`' `career_experiences`/`career_projects`/
   `career_certificates`/`career_awards` read rule became `isCareerReadable(data)`:
   `data.visibility == 'public' || isMineOrPublic(data)` — a `visibility: "public"` item is now
   readable with **no** `request.auth` requirement at all, unlike every other collection's
   `isMineOrPublic()`, which always requires it. This is the actual security boundary; the
   page-level `careerVisibility` above is a courtesy, not a hard gate — a determined client could
   still query a specific public career item directly even when `careerVisibility` is `"private"`,
   an accepted tradeoff already documented for `profile.html`'s identical pattern. Each of the 4
   Career CMS forms gained a third **Trusted Connections** visibility radio (alongside the
   existing Public/Private), reusing `isMineOrPublic()`'s pre-existing (and previously unused by
   Career) connections-tier clause — no rules change needed for that part. `storage.rules` gained
   a matching `career/{uid}/connections/` path.
4. **`public_profiles/{uid}`** — a new, world-readable (`allow read: if true`) collection: a
   denormalized `{uid, displayName, username, photoURL, role, careerVisibility}` mirror of
   `users/{uid}` with **`email` deliberately excluded** (kept in `users/{uid}` only, which stays
   auth-required) — see the "Do not make users/{uid} fully public" guardrail this was built to
   satisfy. Written alongside every existing flow that already writes the source field on
   `users/{uid}` (`login.html`'s upsert, `me.js`'s Display Name/username save, `career.js`'s
   Resume Visibility control). Also used for the unauthenticated "no `?u=`/`?uid=` param" default
   — `resolveOwnerUidFallback()` queries `public_profiles` `where role == "owner"` — since
   `users` itself can't be queried without auth. `usernames/{username}` (already holding nothing
   but `{uid, createdAt}`) had its read rule opened from auth-required to `if true` for the same
   reason: an anonymous `resume.html?u=...` visitor needs to resolve a handle to a uid.
5. **`resume.html` routing + viewer mode** — supports `?u=username` (preferred) / `?uid=userUid`,
   resolved the same way `profile.html` resolves its own `?u=`/`?uid=` (username via
   `usernames/{username}`, falling back to the Owner via `public_profiles` when no param is
   given). `career.js`'s fetches are now scoped to the resolved target uid (previously: a single
   global "every public item across the whole collection, plus mine" merge — functionally
   equivalent in practice since Career has only ever had one writer, but not correct as a
   per-profile viewer). Edit affordances (Add/Edit/Delete buttons, the visibility card) now key
   off `canEdit` (`isOwner(user) && user.uid === targetUid`) instead of a bare `isOwner(user)`
   check, so viewing someone else's resume while signed in as the Owner never shows edit controls
   for content that isn't actually the Owner's own uid. `#career-subnav`/`#career-main` are hidden
   and `#career-access-notice` shown (private / connections-required / not-found, per
   `careerVisibility`) when this viewer isn't allowed to see the resume at all. The static
   Profile/Education/Leadership prose (out of Career CMS scope since v2.6) is unchanged and still
   describes the Owner specifically — it hides along with everything else under
   `#career-main` for a denied viewer, and is not (yet) re-derived per-target-uid, a known
   limitation given Career has no other multi-tenant writer today.
6. **`profile.html` "View Resume" CTA** — a new `#resume-cta` link, shown when: the viewer is
   looking at their own profile, the viewer is the app Owner, the target's `careerVisibility` is
   `"public"`, or it's `"connections"` and the viewer is an accepted friend of the target (reusing
   `profile.js`'s existing `isAcceptedFriendOfTarget()`) — links to `resume.html?u=<username>` or
   the `?uid=` fallback. Does not duplicate any Career UI; the existing inline `#career-section`
   preview list on `profile.html` is unchanged.
7. **Resume PDF upload** (brief's "Resume PDF if uploaded") was **not implemented** — scoped out
   to keep this pass to the actual reported bug (visibility/access) plus the explicitly-requested
   routing/unauth pieces; see the deliverable notes for the reasoning. `download-cv-btn`'s
   `window.print()` behavior (v2.6) is unchanged and still the only "export your resume" path.
8. **i18n**: new `career.*` keys (`public_resume_link`, `visibility_hint`,
   `visibility_connections_label`, `visibility_public_label`, `visibility_saved`,
   `resume_private_notice`, `resume_connections_notice`, `resume_not_found`) and `profile.*` keys
   (`view_resume`, `view_career_profile` — the CTA button uses `view_resume`). Reuses the
   pre-existing `common.private`/`common.public` for the Public/Private radio labels.
9. **Brand & navigation**: no nav changes (no new page — `resume.html`'s route is parameterized,
   not a new file). Footer version not bumped sitewide for this pass (a narrower, single-page-area
   fix rather than a full versioned release pass like v3.2's).

**"EdenAtlas v3.2.3" — resume viewer-mode shell fix.** v3.2.2 fixed *access* to a
shared resume link but left the surrounding app shell untouched — a friend/connection/public HR
visitor opening `resume.html?u=username` still saw the full private-app desktop sidebar/mobile
nav (Finance, Inbox, Time Capsule, Me, etc.), and a non-owner viewer's sidebar was missing Career
entirely (it's an owner-heavy-module link, dropped from `js/sidebar.js`'s `LIGHT_LINKS`/
`js/mobile-nav.js`'s drawer for any non-owner regardless of what page they're actually on). Fixed
purely at the shell layer, no access-control change:
- `career.js` gained `applyViewerModeClass()`, toggling `resume-viewer-mode`/`resume-owner-mode`
  on `<body>`. Viewer mode is `!canEdit && (hasTargetParam || !auth.currentUser)` — deliberately
  *not* a bare `!canEdit`, so a non-owner who opens bare `resume.html` directly (no `?u=`/`?uid=`,
  e.g. a stale bookmark) keeps their normal role-based nav instead of losing all navigation with
  no way back. `canEdit` is now also reset to `false` at the top of `initCareerAccess()` (a
  latent staleness bug: it was previously only ever reassigned mid-function, so an early-return
  notice path after a prior call had granted edit access could theoretically leave a stale `true`
  across an auth change).
- `styles.css` gained a `body.resume-viewer-mode` block hiding `#eden-sidebar`/`#mobile-topbar`/
  `#mobile-bottomnav`/`#mobile-drawer`/`#mobile-drawer-backdrop`/`#quickadd-sheet-overlay` (the
  same selector list already used by the existing `@media print` rule, just gated by class
  instead of print context) and zeroing the sidebar/mobile-nav body padding — no `sidebar.js`/
  `mobile-nav.js` changes, so mobile shell behavior elsewhere in the app is untouched. This is
  Option 1 from the fix brief (hide the shell entirely) rather than a minimal public sidebar,
  since resume.html's own sticky `#career-subnav` already gives in-page navigation and a
  `download-cv-btn`/Profile link already exists for wayfinding.
- No `Public Resume Link` card, edit/upload controls, or Firestore/Storage rules changes were
  needed — those were already correctly gated by `canEdit` from v3.2.2, only the sidebar/mobile
  nav chrome was the gap.
- Added a `TODO` comment above `resume.html`'s static Contact block (email/phone are hardcoded
  markup, not read from `users/{uid}` or Auth, so this isn't a data-exposure regression) noting
  that per-viewer contact visibility controls are a future improvement, not yet built.

**"EdenAtlas v3.3" — "Friend Spaces."** Friends could already browse and
like/comment, but the audit for this pass found their *own* create rights were already correct
at the rules layer for the shareable modules (`canParticipate()` = Owner or Friend has always
gated `photos`/`journals`/`life_events`/`habits`/`collections` creation, each scoped to
`request.resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid`, and `js/sidebar.js`/`js/mobile-nav.js`'s
`LIGHT_LINKS`/`OWNER_ONLY_HREFS` already gave non-owners a working Home/Memories/Atlas/Journal/
Calendar/Connections/Inbox/Habits/Me nav) — what was actually missing was the *other* direction:
several Owner-only-in-spirit modules (Finance, Time Capsule, Daily Reflection) were still
`canParticipate()`-gated at the rules layer and, on `index.html`/`me.html` specifically (unlike
`expenses.html`/`time-capsule.html`, which already redirect non-owners via
`data-owner-only="true"`), were rendered unconditionally to *any* signed-in user, Friend
included. This pass closes that gap rather than opening new ones:
1. **Finance/Time Capsule/Daily Reflection become Owner-only, not just Owner-*default*.**
   [firestore.rules](firestore.rules)'s `expenses`/`time_capsules`/`daily_reflections` `create`
   rules changed from `canParticipate()` to `isOwner()` — `goals` was deliberately left alone
   (never called out as one of the three restricted modules, still Owner-or-Friend). `read`/
   `update`/`delete` on all four were **not** tightened — they stay a bare
   `resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid` check, so any expenses/capsules a Friend created
   under the pre-v3.3 rules remain fully theirs to view/edit; only *new* writes are cut off,
   nothing is stranded or deleted. [storage.rules](storage.rules)'s `capsules/{uid}` path write
   check changed from `canParticipate(email)` to the same Owner-email check `career/{uid}`
   already uses, for the same reason.
2. **`index.html` (the one place these three modules were reachable without a page-level
   redirect) now gates them client-side too**, via a new `isOwnerRole(user)` helper (same
   `isOwner(user) || getUserMode() === "OWNER"` fallback `js/sidebar.js`/`js/mobile-nav.js`
   already use, so a missing/cleared `lfj:userMode` cache can't wrongly collapse the Owner's own
   Home): the Daily Reflection card, the Time Capsule "ready" notice, and Quick Actions' Add
   Expense/Time Capsule buttons all now check `isOwnerRole()` instead of `canParticipate()`; the
   Today's Overview "Spending" row and the Monthly Summary "Expenses" tile are hidden for
   non-owners rather than showing a stub "RM 0.00" for a module they can't use. The Expenses
   tile's grid slot is reused for a new **Connections** count (`friendships/{uid}/friends`
   subcollection size) so the tile row doesn't just go empty for a Friend.
   [me.js](me.js)/[me.html](me.html)'s Overview tab got the equivalent fix: `renderExpenseAnalytics()`
   and `loadCapsulesSummary()` now gate on `isOwner(user)` (previously unconditional and
   `canParticipate()` respectively), and `renderAchievements()` drops the Expenses-Recorded tile
   for non-owners — the same "never surface an expenses-derived stat to a non-owner" rule
   `profile.js`'s `PUBLIC_ACHIEVEMENTS` already applied to *other* people's profiles, now applied
   to a Friend's own Overview too.
3. **New content defaults to Private, not Public.** The "New Post" (`gallery.html`), "New Entry"
   (`journal.html`), and both Quick Add modals' (`index.html`) visibility radios now default to
   `private` instead of `public` — a plain static-HTML `checked` swap, sitewide, not
   role-specific (Owner's own new posts default private too now). This was an explicit ask, not
   a bug fix — no `firestore.rules` implication either way, since visibility was always a
   required field the submitter chose.
4. **Copy, not code, for the "don't call a Friend a Viewer" ask**: `me.role_friend_desc`/
   `me.whitelist_desc` (both locales) dropped their "...Finance..." /"...expenses..." mentions
   now that Finance is Owner-only; a new `friend_space.*` i18n namespace
   (`my_space`/`private_space_note`/`shared_with_connections`/`add_memory`/`write_journal`/
   `your_memories`/`your_journal`/`start_your_edenatlas`) was added in both locales, though only
   `my_space`/`private_space_note` are wired to real UI so far — a new one-line note under
   `index.html`'s greeting, shown only to non-owners. The rest exist for a future dedicated
   "Friend Spaces" onboarding surface that this pass's scope didn't justify building; see Known
   Limitations below. No `role_viewer_desc`/whitelist-management text was touched beyond that —
   both remain Owner-facing admin copy describing the pre-existing whitelist role system (a
   separate, unchanged concept from what's private per-module), not something a Friend/Viewer
   ever sees about themselves.
5. **Explicitly unchanged**: `gallery.js`/`journal.js`/`sidebar.js`/`mobile-nav.js`/
   `auth-guard.js` needed no code changes — the audit confirmed Friend create/edit/delete-own
   for Memories/Journal, and Friend nav hiding Career/Finance/Reports/Time Capsule/Constellation,
   were already correct from v3.2. Career stays Owner-only-to-write (unchanged). No new
   collections, no new pages, no chat/feed/comments/likes changes.
6. **Known limitations**: the new `friend_space.*` copy keys beyond `my_space`/
   `private_space_note` aren't wired to any UI yet (no dedicated "Friend Spaces" home/onboarding
   view was built this pass — the existing Home/nav already satisfied the functional ask, so a
   parallel UI wasn't justified). Two-account (Owner + Friend) live QA against the deployed
   Firebase project was **not** performed as part of this pass (no second Google test account/
   emulator available in this environment) — verification was static: `node --check` on every
   changed `.js`/inline `<script type="module">`, `JSON.parse` on both locale files, and a
   manual trace of the new rules against the brief's QA scenarios. Run the real two-account QA
   checklist from the v3.3 brief before treating this as fully verified in production, and run
   `npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules,storage` (not run automatically by this
   pass) to actually publish the rules changes.

**"HR-ready resume restructure"** — `resume.html`'s static content was reorganized
into a standard resume formula, HTML + locale keys only (no `career.js`, rules, nav, or schema
changes; the CMS sections and viewer/owner modes are untouched). New section order in
`#career-main`: `#profile` (name + one-line headline + inline contact row with email/phone/
GitHub/portfolio/location + a "Profile Summary" block), `#education` (new standalone section,
moved out of the profile card — degree | institution | date + CGPA/coursework bullets),
`#experience` (CMS), `#projects` (CMS), `#events` Leadership & Events (moved after Projects; the
IBT 2026 Chairperson entry is now a featured block with scope/impact bullets — ~300 students,
40+ committee — the other entries stay compact rows), `#certificates` (CMS), `#inventory` Awards
(CMS — the static skill-tile grid that used to live at its bottom is gone), and a new `#skills`
section (grouped pill rows: Languages / Programming & Technical / Frameworks & Platforms /
Tools / Professional Skills). `#career-subnav` gained Education/Skills anchors and follows the
new order; section *ids* were still not renamed (`events`/`inventory` keep their legacy names).
New `career.*` i18n keys in both locales: `summary_header`, `skills_header`, `skills_languages`,
`skills_programming`, `skills_platforms`, `skills_tools`, `skills_soft`.

**"Resume polish"** — print quality + Owner-only resume exposure. No rules
changes, no nav changes, no new pages.
1. **A4 print styles** — `styles.css`'s `@media print` block (which used to just hide chrome and
   force a white body) is now a full resume print stylesheet: `@page { size: A4; margin: 12mm }`;
   also hides `#resume-public-topbar`/`#career-visibility-card`/`#auth-control`/`#eden-splash`/
   all `button`s/all `.fixed` modals/a new opt-in `.print-hidden` class, plus the `html::before`
   logo watermark; forces `.reveal { opacity: 1 }` so scripts.js's scroll-reveal never prints
   below-the-fold sections invisible; flattens `#career-main` sections to plain blocks with
   ruled 13pt headings (the `#profile` name prints as a 20pt unruled letterhead line); remaps
   the dark-theme text utilities to print ink (#111/#444) with underlined http/mailto links;
   forces the project/certificate/award grids single-column, hides cover images and the avatar
   placeholder, and puts `break-inside: avoid` on every per-entry card (sections themselves may
   still flow across pages).
2. **Button label** — `#download-cv-btn` says "Print / Save PDF" (lucide `printer` icon), the
   card copy explains it opens the browser print dialog; still `window.print()`, no PDF library.
   New `career.*` keys in both locales: `download_cv`, `download_cv_hint`, `print_save_pdf`.
3. **Owner-only View Resume CTA** — `profile.js`'s `renderResumeCta()` now requires the *target*
   profile's `users/{uid}.role === "owner"` (threaded through `cachedProfileData` as
   `targetRole`) before any per-viewer check runs, replacing the old `isOwner(viewer)` clause
   that wrongly showed the CTA to the Owner on *friends'* profiles (friends have no resume —
   Career is Owner-only-to-write). Within an owner-target profile the viewer gate is unchanged:
   self, `careerVisibility === "public"`, or connections-tier for an accepted friend. A friend
   viewing their *own* profile no longer sees the CTA either.
4. **Resume-page backstop** — `career.js`'s `initCareerAccess()` shows the existing
   `resume_not_found` notice when a shared `?u=`/`?uid=` link resolves to a non-owner target
   (`person.role !== "owner"`), instead of rendering an empty resume wrapped around the Owner's
   static Profile/Education/Leadership prose. Deliberately skipped for `isSelf` so a
   `users/{uid}` getDoc race can never lock the Owner out of their own resume; bare
   `resume.html` visits (no param) are untouched.

**"EdenAtlas v3.4" — "Shared Profile Detail Navigation"** makes `profile.html`'s
preview content openable, read-only, and privacy-safe. No new pages, no new URL routes, no
`firestore.rules`/`storage.rules` changes (the audit confirmed the existing rules already allow
every legitimate read: connections/public via `isMineOrPublic()`, own docs via the uid clause),
no nav/mobile-shell changes, no new likes/comments anywhere.
1. **Task-1 audit result**: outside `collection-detail.html?id=`, no per-item detail route exists
   anywhere (module pages only take `?new=1`), and Profile's photo modal was the sole detail
   viewer. Rather than invent URL-routed detail pages, all detail views live as **modals on
   `profile.html` itself**, rendered from the already-visibility-filtered arrays `profile.js`
   holds in memory — structurally incapable of widening access, and structurally read-only
   (no edit/delete/upload controls exist in them at all).
2. **New shared read-only detail modal** (`#item-modal`) for journal entries and journey
   (life_events) items: owner display name/@handle, a visibility badge, title (+ mood emoji/label
   for journals, via a duplicated `MOOD_META` per the per-page-duplication convention), date,
   `locationName` only (lat/lng deliberately never rendered), journal `imageUrl`, full body
   (escaped via a new `esc()` — full-length user content, unlike the truncated snippets
   elsewhere), and tags. The pre-existing photo modal gained the same owner line + visibility
   badge plus a date · album · location meta row; its like/comment behavior (v3.1) is unchanged.
3. **Clickable previews**: photo grid (already clickable) plus the Journey list, Public Journal
   list, and Recent Activity feed items are now buttons with hover states, chevrons, and
   `profile.open_memory/open_journal/open_journey` tooltips; Public Atlas place pills became
   plain links to `atlas.html` (Atlas stays the one page that owns the map — no per-place detail,
   names only, never coordinates).
4. **Own-profile parity**: when `isSelf`, `profile.js` fetches photos/journals/life_events via a
   single `where("uid","==",me)` query (`fetchMineAll()` — the standard "mine" half, catching
   private/connections and legacy no-visibility docs) instead of the public+connections merge, so
   you can preview/open everything you own, badged with its visibility (`profile.private_item`/
   `common.connections`/`profile.public_item`; missing visibility badges as private). Habits and
   the Career subset stay public-only as before; non-self viewers' fetch paths are untouched.
5. **i18n**: new `profile.*` keys in both locales — `open_memory`, `open_journal`, `open_journey`,
   `shared_with_you` (the connections badge when viewing someone else's item; "与你共享"),
   `public_item`, `private_item`.
6. **Known limitations**: comment lists in the photo modal still display commenter emails
   (pre-existing `c.email` rendering shared with `gallery.js`, predates this pass); the detail
   modal's contents don't live-retranslate if the language switches while it's open (list
   re-renders close over the cached data, so the next open is correct).

**"EdenAtlas v3.4.1" — "Address-based Location & Atlas Sync"** makes location
text-first: a place is a *name/address you type*, and coordinates are an explicit, optional
add-on. No backend, no geocoding API, no `firestore.rules`/`storage.rules` changes (this
ruleset never restricts field sets via `hasOnly()`), no mobile-shell changes, no migration.
1. **Standardized optional location fields** on `photos`/`journals`/`life_events` writes:
   `locationName`, `locationAddress` (new), `latitude`/`longitude` (existing names kept — the
   brief's conceptual "lat/lng" was deliberately NOT adopted as a field rename, which would
   have orphaned every existing doc and Atlas's queries), and `locationPrecision`
   (`"exact"` when coords exist / `"place"` when only text / `"none"`), derived at save time by
   a `readLocationFields(prefix)` helper duplicated into `gallery.js`/`journal.js`/`timeline.js`
   per the per-page convention. Old docs are read as-is; missing fields mean legacy.
2. **Form UX** (create + edit ×3 pages, 6 forms): stacked "Location name" + "Address / Area"
   inputs, a "This place will appear in your Atlas. Exact coordinates are optional." hint, and
   the old "Use current location" button reworked into **"Use exact location"**
   (`wireExactLocationControls(prefix)`, replacing `wireUseLocationBtn`): it now only fills the
   hidden lat/lng inputs and shows a "Coordinates saved" status chip with a clear (&times;)
   button — it **no longer writes raw coordinates into the visible locationName field** (the old
   autofill baked coords into text visible to anyone the item was shared with, a real leak).
   Status re-syncs on form `reset` events and on edit-modal prefill.
3. **Atlas Saved Places** — `clusterItems()` now returns `{ mapClusters, placeClusters }`:
   items with coords pin on the Leaflet map exactly as before; items with only a
   locationName/locationAddress group by name into a new `#saved-places-section` card grid
   (name, address, per-type counts), and clicking a place card opens the same
   `openDetailPanel()` the map pins use (it never needed coordinates). Empty-state/count moved
   from `renderClusters()` into `setScope()` and covers both lists. Both scope tabs (My Atlas /
   Connections) get places for free since both flow through `clusterItems()`.
4. **Profile privacy** (`profile.js`): the v3.4 detail modals' location line became
   `locationLabelHtml(item)` — shows `locationName · locationAddress` text only, **never raw
   coordinates for anyone**; if an item has only lat/lng (pre-address docs), the owner sees a
   "Coordinates saved" note on their own profile and friends/public viewers see nothing.
   `renderAtlasPlaces()` also counts address-only items now.
5. **i18n**: new `common.*` keys (`location_name`, `location_address`, `location_hint`,
   `use_exact_location`, `location_saved` — currently unused, reserved per the brief —
   `coordinates_saved`) and `atlas.saved_places`/`atlas.saved_places_hint`, both locales.
   `common.use_current_location` stays in the locale files but is no longer referenced.
6. **Known limitations**: `index.html`'s Quick Add photo/journal modals still have no location
   inputs (their docs simply carry no location fields, read as legacy); `locationNote` from the
   brief's data model was not added (no UI asked for it yet); Atlas's Saved Places groups by
   exact name text (no fuzzy matching of "KL" vs "Kuala Lumpur").

**"EdenAtlas v3.4.2" (most recent) — "Place Search & Auto Map Pin"** adds optional geocoding
to the Memories/Journal/Journey location forms: type a place, press **Search place**, pick a
result, and the item saves name + address + coordinates so Atlas pins it automatically. No
backend, no API key, no rules changes, no field renames, no Atlas/profile code changes.
1. **[js/location-search.js](js/location-search.js)** — a new shared pure-helper module (same
   tier as `js/identity.js`, not a self-injecting shell module): `searchPlaces(query)` behind a
   swappable provider object (currently **OpenStreetMap Nominatim** — free, keyless, CORS-open;
   search is button-triggered only, capped at 5 results, `accept-language` follows `getLang()`,
   and the results list renders an OpenStreetMap attribution line, per Nominatim's usage
   policy), plus `wirePlaceSearch(prefix, onCoordsChange)` which wires one form's search
   button/status/results against the v3.4.1 input ids. Queries under 3 chars, zero results, and
   fetch failures each get their own status message. Added to `service-worker.js`'s `PRECACHE`
   (`CACHE` bumped to `eden-shell-v12`) since precached pages import it. The Nominatim request
   itself is never intercepted — the SW passes all cross-origin requests through.
2. **Coordinates only on explicit selection.** Typing alone never geocodes: picking a result
   fills name/address/hidden lat/lng and a new hidden `{prefix}-location-precision-hint` input
   (`"place_resolved"`); the GPS "Use exact location" button sets it to `"exact"`.
   `readLocationFields()` now emits `locationPrecision: "place_resolved"` for search-picked
   coords ("exact" for GPS/legacy, "place"/"none" as before — Atlas treats both coord tiers
   identically, it only looks at lat/lng). The status chip reads **"Map pin enabled"** for a
   picked place vs "Coordinates saved" for GPS, with a `place_pin_hint` tooltip; the existing
   × clear button also clears the hint (title: `clear_selected_place`).
3. **Safer rename behavior (Task 5)**: manually editing the location-name input *after*
   selecting a search result clears the saved coordinates and returns the item to place-only
   mode (status: "Saved as place only") — the typed text may no longer describe that pin.
   Programmatic `.value` writes (result selection, edit-modal prefill) don't fire `input`, so
   they're unaffected. Edit modals prefill the hint from the doc's stored `locationPrecision`,
   so a re-saved item keeps `place_resolved` unless touched.
4. **i18n**: new `common.*` keys in both locales — `search_place`, `place_search`,
   `select_this_place`, `no_places_found`, `map_pin_enabled`, `clear_selected_place`,
   `search_min_chars`, `could_not_search_places`, `saved_as_place_only`, `place_pin_hint`.
5. **Privacy unchanged**: friends/public viewers still only ever see locationName/
   locationAddress text (v3.4.1's `locationLabelHtml()` never renders coordinates for anyone);
   `place_resolved` items are labeled by place text like everything else.
6. **Known limitations**: Nominatim has no SLA and rate-limits aggressively (button-based
   search keeps volume low, but a burst of searches can 429 — surfaced as "Could not search
   places"); results quality for small local businesses ("My favorite mamak") is limited —
   those stay place-only by design; no reverse geocoding (the GPS button still saves bare
   coordinates without deriving a name); `index.html` Quick Add modals still have no location
   UI.
7. **Edit/Atlas refresh hotfix (v3.4.2, follow-up pass)** — live testing reported "location
   added via the edit modal doesn't show in Atlas." The audit re-verified the persistence
   chain (all three pages' edit `updateDoc` payloads spread `readLocationFields()`, prefill
   restores name/address/coords/precision-hint — that part was already correct); the real
   defects were Atlas-side: (a) the module-level `mineClusters`/`connectionsClusters` caches
   never invalidated while an Atlas page stayed alive (PWA window / background tab), so
   content edited on another page never appeared until a full navigation — a `visibilitychange`
   listener now drops both caches and refetches the active scope whenever Atlas becomes
   visible again; (b) `itemMillis()` ignored `updatedAt`, so the Connections tab's
   100-most-recent cap could slice out an *old* doc that just had its location added —
   `updatedAt` now participates first. `service-worker.js` `CACHE` bumped to `eden-shell-v13`
   so stale pre-v3.4.2 runtime-cached page JS gets purged on SW update.
8. **Second follow-up (edited-item pin still missing live)** — the reported "orderBy/limit
   truncation" hypothesis was verified **false**: no Atlas query uses `orderBy`/`limit` at all
   (My Atlas fetches every own doc; Connections' only cap is the client-side, now
   updatedAt-aware `slice(0,100)`), so no `orderBy("updatedAt")` merge query was added — it
   would also demand a composite index, against this repo's convention. Real fixes shipped
   instead: (a) **coordinate parsing** — `clusterItems()` used `!= null` truthy-ish checks, so
   one doc with unparseable coords could throw inside the marker loop (`L.marker` on an
   invalid LatLng aborts rendering for every later cluster — "the map only shows one pin") or
   crash Connections' `toFixed()` rounding; a `parseCoord()` helper (0-safe, accepts numeric
   strings, rejects NaN/blank) now gates the coords branch, and invalid-coord items degrade to
   Saved Places when they still carry place text; (b) **spurious-input guard** in
   `js/location-search.js` — mobile autocorrect/autocapitalize can fire `input` without
   changing the text, which used to silently drop just-selected coordinates before save; the
   rename listener now ignores events whose trimmed text still equals the selected result's
   name; (c) **opt-in debug tracing** (`localStorage.setItem("eden_atlas_debug","1")`):
   atlas.js logs per-collection fetch counts, cluster stats (withCoords/placeOnly/
   invalidCoords/noLocation) and per-item skip reasons, and gallery/journal/timeline log the
   exact edit `updateDoc` payload after a successful save — silent by default; (d)
   `atlas.html`/`atlas.js` added to `PRECACHE` (a pre-existing omission since v2.7) and
   `CACHE` bumped to `eden-shell-v14`. Cluster keys are place-text-based, so distinct places
   (Subang vs Kampar) can never merge into one pin — verified, no clustering change needed.

**"EdenAtlas v3.5" — "Recruiter Portfolio"** adds a second, fully-public recruiter-facing entry
alongside the private Personal OS, with no framework, no build step, no Firebase
architecture/rules changes, and no change to the Owner/Friend/Public role logic or the login-first
app. Two new public pages plus optional CMS fields:
1. **[portfolio.html](portfolio.html)/[portfolio.js](portfolio.js)** — a standalone public
   one-pager (Hero → At-a-glance snapshot → Selected Work → Experience → Leadership → Skills →
   Education → About → Contact), **not** login-gated: it deliberately omits `auth-guard.js`,
   `sidebar.js`, `mobile-nav.js`, `global-search.js` and `splash.js`, and carries
   `<body class="public-page …">` (a new `styles.css` rule zeroing the sidebar/mobile body
   padding, same shape as `resume-viewer-mode`). It reads the Career CMS **anonymously** via each
   career doc's public read rule (`isCareerReadable`, unchanged since v3.2.2 — a
   `visibility=='public'` career doc is readable with no `request.auth`), querying
   `where("visibility","==","public")` on `career_projects`/`career_experiences` (the same
   single-field, index-free query shape career.js used pre-v3.2.2 — **live-tested logged-out**:
   the query returns `readTime` unauthenticated, while the same query *without* the visibility
   filter returns `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`, exactly matching the rules-provability model). As of
   the hardening pass, the deployed DB has **zero** public career docs, so the fallback is the live
   path today. **Source-of-truth policy is a deterministic per-slug merge** (`buildWorkList()`):
   for each of the three expected slugs (`edenatlas`/`utar-epms`/`enterprise-ai-ops`) a public CMS
   project matched by slug is preferred, else the curated `FALLBACK_PROJECTS` entry fills that one
   slot; additional public **featured** CMS projects are appended newest-first, deduped by slug/id.
   A **private** CMS doc is never fetched (public-only query) so it can never override or suppress a
   public fallback. All Firestore-derived values render via DOM `textContent`/element construction
   (a small `h()` helper), never interpolated into `innerHTML` — only static module constants
   (hero labels/leadership/skills/about) still use escaped `innerHTML`. Default English with an
   EN/中文 toggle wired to the
   existing `setLang()`/`eden:langchange` triad; all bilingual content re-renders on language
   change (dynamic content is JS-rendered from `{en,zh}` objects, chrome via `data-i18n`). Content
   is privacy-scrubbed per the brief: internship company/systems anonymized ("AI technology
   company", "identity-verification review tool", "AutoML / chat-bot administration system"), no
   IC/face/client data, no metrics fabricated, no phone number (résumé-only), and a
   "worked with / familiar" skills group kept distinct from proficiencies.
2. **[project.html](project.html)/[project.js](project.js)** — a reusable public case-study
   renderer (`?slug=…`, opened from Selected Work): eight sections (Overview / Problem / My Role /
   Investigation & Decisions / Solution / Result / What I Learned / Technology) + Previous/Next
   across a fixed `ORDER` of the three featured slugs (`edenatlas`/`utar-epms`/`enterprise-ai-ops`).
   A CMS project matched by `slug` is **merged field-by-field over** a curated `CASE_STUDIES`
   fallback (CMS value wins when non-empty, fallback fills gaps), so a case study is never blank;
   an unknown slug with no CMS match shows a "not found" state. Same public shell/i18n as
   portfolio.
3. **Career CMS extension** — `career_projects` gained optional, backward-compatible public
   case-study fields (`slug`, bilingual `role`/`challenge`/`actions`/`outcome`), surfaced through a
   collapsible "Public Case Study (optional)" `<details>` block in `resume.html`'s project form and
   read/written by `career.js`'s `openProjectForm()`/submit. All default to `""`; legacy projects
   render fine everywhere without them. No `firestore.rules`/`storage.rules` change (this ruleset
   never restricts field sets). `resume.html`'s Contact "Portfolio" link now points at
   `portfolio.html` (was `index.html`). `service-worker.js` `CACHE` bumped to `eden-shell-v15`
   with `portfolio.html`/`project.html`/`portfolio.js`/`project.js` added to `PRECACHE` — the
   bump also forces the edited `styles.css`/locale files to re-precache instead of serving stale
   offline (online behaviour stays network-first, unchanged).
4. **Explicitly unchanged / not done**: `index.html` (the private Home) is untouched — the brief
   scoped the "point `/` at Portfolio" routing change out of this pass. No deploy/push. The
   internship Experience company name and the featured-project slugs still need the Owner to enter
   them in the CMS to switch from the curated fallback to live data (documented for the user).
   Verification run: `node --check` on the new modules, `JSON.parse` on both locales, an
   element-id cross-check between each new page and its script, an i18n-key presence check across
   EN/ZH, a standalone unit test of `buildWorkList()` across all six CMS states + edge cases (10/10
   pass), a **live logged-out Firestore REST test** confirming the public career query is permitted
   (and the denied control), and an HTTP-level static-server check that every page + local asset
   serves 200. **Not** run (no browser/second account in this environment): interactive browser QA
   (console errors, responsive breakpoints, focus states, live EN/中文 toggle, Google sign-in flow)
   and two-account Owner/Friend QA — a manual checklist was handed to the user instead. Footer
   version on the two new pages is `3.5`; the other 19 pages' footers were left as-is (narrow,
   additive pass).

**"Login-Alignment + Public-Résumé Unification"** — a three-part fix pass, no new pages, no
Firebase/rules/schema changes, no deploy. (1) **Login centring**: `styles.css` gained a
`body.login-bg` rule zeroing the sitewide sidebar `padding-left: var(--sidebar-w)` (and the mobile
top/bottom nav-clearance padding) that was being inherited by `login.html` — which loads neither
`js/sidebar.js` nor `js/mobile-nav.js` — and pushing the card+footer ~240px right of the viewport
centre while the fixed background rings stayed centred. (2) **Public résumé**: `resume.html` was
already `data-public-optional` (no login redirect), but `career.js`'s no-param + signed-out path
showed a `signin_required` notice — it now calls a new `resolveOwnerUidFallback()`
(`public_profiles where role=="owner"`, world-readable, no auth) and renders the Owner's public
career profile, treating a never-set `careerVisibility` as `"public"` on that canonical route only
(an explicit private/connections is still respected). `#resume-public-topbar` was rebuilt into a
recruiter toolbar (Back to Portfolio + EN/中文 + Print/Save PDF, all `no-print`), wired in
`career.js` via the existing `setLang`/`window.print()`. (3) **Unified internal/external**:
`computeAccess()`'s `isSelf` branch dropped `includeAllMine`/`includeConnections` — the Owner's own
preview now shows the exact public-filtered content a recruiter sees (edit affordances stay, gated
by the separate `canEdit`; a Private/Connections career item no longer appears in the résumé for
anyone). Canonical fallback Experience/Project records render per-collection when the CMS is empty, gated to
the Owner's résumé via `targetIsOwner`, marked `_fallback` so no Owner edit/delete controls attach.
Portfolio hero CTA → "View / Download Résumé"; new `career.back_to_portfolio` i18n key (EN/ZH).

**Résumé consistency cleanup (follow-up to the above)** — three loose ends closed, no auth/rules/
schema changes: (1) **Single source of truth** — the previously-duplicated fallback constants moved
into a new shared ES module [js/resume-data.js](js/resume-data.js) (`PROFILE`, `EDUCATION`,
`EXPERIENCE`, `PROJECTS`, `LEADERSHIP`, `RESUME_SKILLS`, all bilingual `{en,zh}`), imported by
`portfolio.js` (Experience/Projects/Leadership), `career.js` (all six, adapted to its flat CMS
render shape) and `project.js` (project name/tag only — its deep case-study narratives stay local);
each Experience/Project record now has exactly one definition. `portfolio.js` renders only the
`featured` LEADERSHIP subset (its original three); the résumé renders all six. (2) **Fully bilingual
résumé** — `resume.html`'s Profile Summary, Education, Leadership and Skills/Languages are no longer
static English HTML; they're empty containers (`#resume-headline`/`#resume-summary`/
`#resume-location`/`#education-list`/`#leadership-list`/`#skills-list`) rendered by `career.js` from
the shared source and re-rendered on `eden:langchange`, so EN⇄中文 switches the whole résumé with no
reload and Print prints the selected language. Skill group headers stay `data-i18n` (interface
labels in the locale files); language/soft-skill item names translate via the shared data. These
sections populate only for the Owner's résumé (`targetIsOwner`). (3) `service-worker.js` `CACHE` →
`eden-shell-v17` with `js/resume-data.js` added to `PRECACHE`. Visibility invariant re-audited and
unchanged: anonymous Career reads only ever run `where("visibility","==","public")` (the
`includeAllMine`/connections paths require auth), so `isCareerReadable`'s no-auth branch reduces to
`data.visibility == 'public'` — private/connections/legacy-missing-visibility docs are excluded by
both the query and the rule, and the page-level `careerVisibility` default only decides whether the
shell renders, never what items are fetched. **v18 follow-up**: the résumé's Projects section had a
leftover portfolio-style "Featured Projects" strip (`#featured-projects-section`) *in addition to*
the `#projects-list` grid — once the shared fallback marked all projects `featured`, `renderProjects()`
rendered the same three into both containers, so they showed twice. Fixed at source by deleting the
strip markup + its render branch (résumé keeps the single `#projects-list` grid; the `featured` flag
still drives portfolio.js's Selected Work). `service-worker.js` `CACHE` → `eden-shell-v18` so the
edited resume.html/career.js/styles.css evict atomically.

**Location pipeline fix (most recent)** — investigated a reported "Memories → Search Location →
Save → Atlas marker missing" bug. Traced every path (Nominatim search-select, GPS "Use exact
location", raw text, edit without/with a location change) through `gallery.js`/`journal.js`/
`timeline.js`'s create+edit handlers and `atlas.js`'s fetch/cluster/render pipeline; no EXIF
extraction feature exists anywhere in this codebase (the bug report's "working path" premise
doesn't match reality — confirmed by grepping for exif/GPS-extraction UI text, none found). The
search-select and GPS paths already converged on the same write shape (both already fixed by the
earlier, already-committed "v3.4.2 follow-up" passes — coordinate parsing, cache invalidation),
but two real gaps remained: (1) `js/location-search.js`'s `wirePlaceSearch()` tracked a
`selectedName` closure variable used to tell a real manual rename apart from a spurious "input"
event — it was only ever set by a fresh in-form search-select, never by an edit modal's
programmatic prefill of an *existing* `place_resolved` location, so any no-op input event during
an edit session (mobile autocorrect, retyping identical text) could silently null out valid,
already-saved coordinates before the next save, dropping a previously-mapped item's Atlas marker
after an unrelated metadata edit; (2) neither the write side (`readLocationFields`) nor the read
side (`atlas.js`'s coordinate parsing) enforced latitude/longitude range (-90..90/-180..180), so
an out-of-range value could reach Firestore or reach Leaflet unfiltered. Fixed by extracting the
three near-identical `getBrowserLocation`/`wireExactLocationControls`/`readLocationFields` copies
in `gallery.js`/`journal.js`/`timeline.js` into one canonical module,
[js/location-fields.js](js/location-fields.js) (`parseCoordinate`, `validateCoords` — finite AND
in-range, never a fabricated `{0,0}` fallback — `normalizeLocation`, `readLocationFields`,
`wireExactLocationControls`), which both the three pages and `js/location-search.js` (Nominatim
results) and `atlas.js` (cluster/marker read side) now import instead of maintaining separate
copies — search/manual, GPS, and any future location source all funnel through the same
`normalizeLocation()` before a Firestore write, and the read side validates the same way before a
doc is allowed to produce a marker. `wirePlaceSearch()` now returns `{ confirmPlace(name) }`;
each page's `openEditModal()` calls it right after prefilling an existing location, closing gap
(1). Schema unchanged (`locationName`/`locationAddress`/`latitude`/`longitude`/
`locationPrecision`, same as v3.4.1/v3.4.2) — no migration, existing legacy/malformed docs
degrade safely to Saved Places or are skipped, never crash the marker loop. UX: the "Use exact
location" status chip now shows the confirmed place name (`common.location_confirmed`, "Confirmed:
{name}") when one exists; a successful save with valid coordinates shows a "View on Atlas" link
(`common.view_on_atlas`) before the modal auto-closes, on all three pages. New i18n keys
(`common.location_confirmed`, `common.location_invalid`, `common.view_on_atlas`) in both locales.
`service-worker.js` `CACHE` → `eden-shell-v19` with `js/location-fields.js` added to `PRECACHE`
(the fetch handler is network-first, so this bump only matters for the offline-fallback path, not
normal online use). No Firestore/Storage rules changes (this bug was never a rules/permissions
issue), no production writes, no deploy.

**Memory Trash + location-edit fix (most recent)** — the Memories module gained a reversible
Trash workflow (`gallery.html`/`gallery.js` only; Journal/Journey were left untouched — Trash was
scoped to Memories per the brief) and the Edit Memory modal gained full add/change/remove-location
support built on top of the v19 canonical pipeline. No new Firestore collection, no rules changes
(audited and confirmed `firestore.rules`' existing `photos` `update`/`delete` rule —
`resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid || resource.data.uploadedBy == request.auth.uid` — already
correctly gates Trash/Restore/Permanent-Delete per-document; `storage.rules`' `gallery/{uid}/...`
`write` rule already covers `deleteObject` the same way).
1. **Trash schema** — `photos` docs gain optional `deletedAt` (`serverTimestamp()` or
   `null`/missing) and `deletedBy` (uid). Missing/null `deletedAt` always means active, including
   every pre-existing doc — no migration. Move to Trash / Restore are both plain `updateDoc`
   calls (never `deleteDoc`), keeping the doc, its Storage file, caption/tags/visibility/location
   fully intact either way.
2. **New shared module [js/memory-filters.js](js/memory-filters.js)** — `isDeleted(item)` /
   `isActiveMemory(item)` / `excludeDeleted(items)`, the single predicate every photos-reading
   fetch helper across the app now calls before returning results: `gallery.js`
   (`fetchVisiblePosts`/new `fetchTrashedPosts`), `atlas.js` (`clusterItems`'s `addItem`, so a
   trashed Memory produces no marker and no Saved Places card even from a stale cached query
   result), `global-search.js`, `profile.js`, `collections.js`, `collection-detail.js`,
   `insights.js`, `calendar.js`, `me.js`, `constellation.js`, `index.html`'s inline module — all
   of these call a generic `fetchMine`/`mergeMinePublic`/`fetchByVisibility`-style helper already
   shared across many collection types, so the filter applies once per file rather than being
   duplicated per call site. `export.js`'s Backup/Export flow was deliberately left unfiltered —
   a personal data backup should include everything the user owns, trashed or not; it's not one
   of the "active Memories" surfaces the brief listed.
3. **Trash view** — an owner-of-the-document-gated (`canParticipate()`, matching every other
   Memories write gate — "owner-only" here means the record's own `uid`/`uploadedBy`, the
   per-document ownership model this whole app already uses, not the singular app Owner role) new
   `#trash-view` section toggled by a header pill (`#trash-view-btn`) that swaps out the normal
   feed/toolbar in place rather than becoming a new page. Lists the signed-in user's own trashed
   photos via a plain `where("uid","==",myUid)` query (the same "mine" query the normal feed
   already runs — no composite index), filtered to `deletedAt`-truthy client-side. Loading/error/
   empty states; each card offers Restore and Permanently Delete.
4. **Accessible confirm modals** — `gallery.js`'s new `trapFocus()`/`makeConfirmModal()` are the
   first accessible (focus-trapped, Escape-closes, focus-restoring) modals in this codebase; every
   prior destructive action elsewhere (`career.js`, `collections.js`, `time-capsule.js`,
   `dashboard.js`, `me.js`, `settings.js`) used a bare `window.confirm()` and was left as-is (out
   of scope for this pass). Two modals reuse the factory: Move-to-Trash (shows the target photo's
   thumbnail+caption, Cancel/"Move to Trash") and Permanently Delete (reached only from Trash,
   stronger "cannot be undone" copy — the brief's required "second explicit confirmation", Trash
   itself being the first). Both disable their buttons and show a loading label while in flight,
   guarded by a shared `inFlightMemoryOps` id set so a double-click can't double-submit; a failed
   `updateDoc`/`deleteDoc` shows an inline error and leaves the modal open rather than claiming
   success. A new bottom-pinned toast (`#memory-toast`, first of its kind in this app) shows
   "Moved to Trash" with an **Undo** action wired straight to `restorePost()`.
5. **Permanent delete order (Firestore + Storage are two separate client calls, not one
   transaction)** — Storage is deleted **first**; `storage/object-not-found` on that call is
   treated as already-clean (makes a retry after a prior partial failure idempotent, not a second
   error); any other Storage failure stops there and leaves the Firestore doc (and its
   `storagePath`) untouched so the user can retry — deleting the Firestore doc first and letting
   Storage cleanup fail afterward would orphan the file forever, since the one doc that remembered
   its path would be gone. The Firestore doc is only ever deleted once Storage is confirmed clear
   (or was never eligible — see below). Before deleting, `storagePath` must start with
   `gallery/{ownerUid}/` (never derived from the download URL, never an external URL, never
   another user's path by construction) and a defense-in-depth query —
   `where("uid","==",callerUid), where("storagePath","==",post.storagePath)` (two equalities, no
   composite index, provable under `isPhotoMineOrPublic()`) — confirms no *other* doc references
   the same path before the object is deleted, so a hypothetical shared/duplicate path is never
   destroyed out from under another record. This app generates no thumbnails/variants (a single
   `uploadBytes` per photo), so there's nothing else to clean up. No trusted-backend Cloud
   Function exists to make this atomic; that gap is real and is called out as a follow-up
   recommendation, not pretended away.
6. **Edit Memory location editing** — `js/location-fields.js` gained `classifyLocation()`, a pure
   5-state classifier (`none`/`invalid`/`needs_confirmation`/`confirmed_search`/`confirmed_exact`)
   now driving `wireExactLocationControls()`'s status chip (color + copy per state) on all three
   pages (Memories/Journal/Journey, since the function is already shared) — a legacy Memory with
   only a name/address shows **"Location needs confirmation"** (amber) instead of nothing; a
   corrupted/out-of-range legacy value shows **"Invalid location"** (rose, reusing v19's
   `common.location_invalid` key) without ever being at risk of re-persisting, since
   `normalizeLocation()` already discards invalid coordinates at the save boundary regardless of
   what the form displays. `openEditModal()` now explicitly initializes from
   `normalizeLocation(post.locationName/Address/latitude/longitude/locationPrecision)` for the
   visible text fields (never opens a modal by hand-deriving the shape); the hidden lat/lng inputs
   still carry the *raw* stored values (not the sanitized ones) specifically so `classifyLocation`
   can detect and surface the "invalid" state — the save path stays safe either way. A new
   **"Remove location"** control (`js/location-fields.js`'s `wireRemoveLocation()`, wired on both
   the create and edit forms on Memories only, per the brief's explicit scope) clears
   name+address+coordinates+hint together — distinct from the existing "×" (which only clears
   coordinates, keeping typed text so the user can re-search under a corrected name) — and
   requires a second click on the same button within a 4s window as its confirmation (typing in
   the location fields, or letting the window lapse, cancels it) rather than a bare
   `window.confirm()`. Cancel Edit (`closeEditModal()`) was already side-effect-free — confirmed
   unchanged: it only hides+resets the form, no Firestore write happens unless Save is clicked, so
   the cached post and its Atlas marker are untouched. Saving reuses the exact same
   `updateDoc(doc(db,"photos",id), {...readLocationFields("post-edit")})` call as every other edit
   field, so a location change/add/removal always updates the one existing document — never a new
   one — and `fetchVisiblePosts()` afterward refreshes `cachedPosts` from Firestore, invalidating
   any stale in-memory copy.
7. **Atlas sync** — no realtime listener was added (this app has never used `onSnapshot`
   anywhere, by established convention); Atlas already fully tears down and rebuilds every marker
   from a fresh `getDocs` query on every load and on `visibilitychange` (a v3.4.2 fix), which
   already guarantees "no stale/duplicate marker" and "edit moves the marker, remove deletes it,
   trash hides it, restore brings it back" for free — verified by tracing, not changed. What *was*
   added: `clusterItems()`'s `addItem()` now skips any trashed item outright (`isDeleted()`
   check), and every cluster object gained a `memoryIds: Set` (photo doc ids folded in via
   `bump()`) so a specific Memory's marker can be located without inventing a
   one-marker-per-document model (clusters still group multiple items at one place into a single
   pin, unchanged).
8. **Exact-marker deep link** — Memories' post-save success state no longer auto-closes on a
   timer (the v19 2.5s race is gone entirely): with valid coordinates, the modal stays open with a
   persistent "Saved · View on Atlas" line and a disabled submit button (guards against an
   accidental duplicate re-upload) until the user clicks the link or the modal's existing ×/
   backdrop close; without coordinates, it still closes immediately as before. The link now reads
   `atlas.html?memory=<encoded-doc-id>`. `atlas.js`'s new `maybeFocusMemoryFromQuery()` always
   strips the param via `history.replaceState` (no new history entry, works whether or not the id
   resolves) and only ever resolves it against `mineClusters` — built from the uid-scoped
   `fetchMyOnly("photos")` query, so Firestore/firestore.rules have already proven the id belongs
   to the signed-in viewer before this function runs; the query parameter itself is never trusted
   as authorization. A missing/foreign/trashed id is silently ignored (not found in `mineClusters`,
   since trashed items never entered clustering); a match flies the map to it, opens its detail
   panel, and opens that marker's tooltip.
9. **Cache** — `service-worker.js` `CACHE` → `eden-shell-v20`, `js/memory-filters.js` added to
   `PRECACHE` (network-first strategy unchanged; this only affects the offline-fallback path).
10. **Known limitation, documented rather than hidden**: permanent Storage deletion from the
    browser is not atomic with the Firestore delete (see point 5) — a trusted Cloud Function
    (triggered on the Firestore doc's actual deletion, reading `storagePath` server-side) would be
    the fully reliable fix, and is recommended but was **not** built or deployed as part of this
    pass, since no backend function infrastructure exists in this project today. Nothing was
    committed, pushed, or written to production by this pass.

**Trash privacy + ownership-merge fix** — a pre-deployment security review found
that the Trash pass above only filtered trashed Memories client-side (`excludeDeleted()`); it
never touched `firestore.rules`' read rule or the `visibility` field, so a formerly-public Memory
that got trashed **was still directly readable by any signed-in non-owner** (`getDoc` by ID) and
**still matched the public collection query** (`where("visibility","==","public")`) — proven with
a rules-logic simulation (see Tests below) before being fixed, not assumed. `photos` has always
required `request.auth != null` for every read branch (confirmed by re-reading
`isPhotoMineOrPublic()`), so a *signed-out* caller was never able to read a photo at all, trashed
or not — that boundary was already correct and is unaffected; the real gap was any other
signed-in user (Viewer, Friend, or an accepted connections-tier friend).
1. **Fix — preserve-and-privatize, not a rules change.** `submitMoveToTrash()` now also writes
   `visibilityBeforeTrash: <the doc's current visibility>` and `visibility: "private"` alongside
   `deletedAt`/`deletedBy`; `restorePost()` writes `visibility: <visibilityBeforeTrash>` (falling
   back to `"private"` if somehow missing — never assume public) and nulls `visibilityBeforeTrash`
   back out. Because `firestore.rules`' `photos` read rule already treats `visibility: "private"`
   as owner/`uploadedBy`-only (unchanged, no rules edit needed), this alone closes both read paths:
   a direct `getDoc` on a trashed doc now fails the rule for a non-owner, and the public/
   connections collection queries no longer match it server-side either, since the `visibility`
   field itself changed. This was the brief's own suggested "preserve exact previous visibility,
   set private" architecture, adopted as-is since it matched the real schema (`visibility`:
   `public`/`private`/`connections` on `photos`, no separate field to invent). `trashCard()` shows
   a small badge (`memories.restores_to`) reading the *original* tier so the Trash view stays
   honest about what Restore brings back.
2. **Storage exposure — audited, not silently assumed safe.** A `getDownloadURL()` token
   (`?alt=media&token=...`) is a bearer credential that bypasses Storage Security Rules for that
   specific request shape — this is standard Firebase Storage behavior, not a bug introduced
   here. **Trashing a Memory does NOT revoke its existing download URL/token** — anyone who
   already has that URL (e.g. a Viewer whose browser rendered the `<img>` before it was trashed,
   or anyone who copied it) can keep using it for as long as the underlying Storage object
   exists. Only **Permanent Delete** actually removes exposure, because it calls `deleteObject()`
   on the object itself (unchanged from the prior pass — already correct), at which point the URL
   404s for everyone, including anyone still holding it. Documented as a real, load-bearing
   limitation rather than claimed away — a token-rotation/backend proxy would be the only way to
   revoke access while an item merely sits in Trash, and none exists in this project.
3. **Ownership-merge dedup (Gap 2)** — `gallery.js` gained one shared `fetchOwnPosts(uid)` helper
   (uid query + legacy `uploadedBy` query, merged into a `Map` keyed by document ID) that both
   `fetchVisiblePosts()`'s "mine" half and `fetchTrashedPosts()` now call, replacing two
   near-duplicate inline merges — Trash already covered both ownership fields before this pass
   (verified by re-reading the code, not assumed), this was a DRY fix, not a coverage fix: a doc
   carrying both `uid` and `uploadedBy` is still only counted/rendered once.
4. **Edit-location lifecycle (Gap 3) — re-verified, not re-built.** All 6 required scenarios (add
   to a legacy no-location Memory; a name-only legacy value correctly shows "needs confirmation"
   and is never treated as confirmed; changing an already-mapped Memory's place; an unrelated
   caption/tag/visibility edit preserving coordinates exactly; Remove Location saving the
   canonical null state; Cancel discarding all temporary changes) were already correctly
   implemented by the prior pass and are now backed by a deterministic test that exercises the
   real `readLocationFields()`/`classifyLocation()`/`normalizeLocation()` functions against a
   minimal fake-DOM stub reproducing `openEditModal`'s exact prefill sequence (see Tests below) —
   not just re-asserted in prose. `confirmPlace()` is confirmed to only ever receive a name when
   `normalizeLocation()` (which already discards invalid/missing coordinates) reports a genuinely
   valid, `place_resolved`-precision pair; a name-only or invalid legacy value always passes
   `null`. One deliberate non-fix: `wirePlaceSearch`'s rename-guard still only invalidates
   coordinates on a text edit when they came from a search result (`hint === "place_resolved"`),
   not from the GPS button — kept as-is on purpose, since GPS coordinates describe wherever the
   device physically was, independent of whatever label ends up next to them (relabeling a GPS
   pin isn't "changing to a different place" the way editing a search-result's name is); changing
   this would have reintroduced a worse bug (typing a first-time label right after a GPS capture
   would wipe the just-captured pin).
5. **Tests** — since the sandboxed environment has no Java runtime, the real Firestore emulator
   could not run (`npx firebase-tools emulators:exec --only firestore ...` failed with "Could not
   spawn `java -version`", confirmed by attempting it, not assumed unavailable). In its place: (a)
   a rules-logic simulation — `isPhotoMineOrPublic()`/the `photos` update/delete rule translated
   line-for-line into plain JS and checked against `firestore.rules`' literal text, 23 assertions
   covering signed-out/owner/viewer/friend × active-public/active-private/active-connections/
   trashed/restored, including one assertion that reproduces the OLD (pre-fix) scheme specifically
   to prove the gap was real before the fix; (b) a full `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` emulator
   test file, written for future use but explicitly **not executed**; (c) a DOM-stub test exercising
   the real `readLocationFields()` against a fake `document.getElementById`, covering all 6
   edit-location scenarios end-to-end; (d) the ownership-merge dedup logic. All are scratch files,
   not committed to the repo (matches this project's no-test-framework convention). No rules or
   Storage rules were changed, so no rules deploy is required or was performed.
6. **Brand & navigation**: none. `service-worker.js` `CACHE` → `eden-shell-v21` (`gallery.js`
   changed again; no new `PRECACHE` entries). Nothing committed, pushed, deployed, or written to
   production.

**"Portfolio to root" routing change (most recent)** — the site's default GitHub Pages entry
moved from the login-first Personal OS to the public recruiter Portfolio, so opening the shared
URL shows the Portfolio immediately with no auth redirect, while the complete private app is
preserved one click away. No Firebase/rules/schema changes, no deploy.
1. **`index.html` and `home.html` swapped roles.** The private Personal OS Home (daily-habit
   landing page, "On This Day" Memories, Quick Actions, etc. — all its widgets/queries/role
   gating unchanged) moved from `index.html` to a new `home.html`, byte-identical except its own
   dead-header self-link. `index.html` is now the promoted Portfolio markup (previously
   `portfolio.html`) — same hero → snapshot → Selected Work → Experience → Leadership → Skills →
   Education → About → Contact sections, same CMS/fallback merge in `portfolio.js`, same EN/中文
   toggle, unchanged. **`portfolio.html` is now a tiny compatibility redirect stub** (a
   `location.replace()` preserving `location.search`/`location.hash`, plus a 0s `meta refresh`
   and a plain-link fallback for JS-disabled visitors) — it carries no Portfolio markup of its
   own, so the content is never duplicated between the two files. `portfolio.html#work` still
   lands on the root's `#work` section; the redirect never adds a history entry, so there's no
   back-button loop.
2. **Auth-aware "Enter/Open EdenAtlas" CTA** — `index.html`'s two nav CTAs (desktop + mobile menu)
   default to the signed-out markup ("Enter EdenAtlas" → `login.html`, works before Firebase ever
   resolves) and no longer carry `data-i18n` (their label depends on auth state as well as
   language, so `portfolio.js`'s new `renderAppCta()` is the single source for both, re-run on
   `onAuthStateChanged` and on `eden:langchange`). Signed in, they relabel to "Open EdenAtlas" →
   `home.html`. The Portfolio never redirects a signed-in Owner away from itself — this only ever
   relabels two links.
3. **Every private nav surface repointed to `home.html`**: `js/sidebar.js`'s `PRIMARY_LINKS`/
   `LIGHT_LINKS`, `js/mobile-nav.js`'s `DRAWER_LINKS`/`LIGHT_DRAWER_LINKS`/`BOTTOM_ITEMS`, the
   dead (permanently-hidden) `<header>` nav's Home link on every private page, `auth-guard.js`'s
   signed-out redirect fallback and its `data-owner-only` → `?notice=private_space` target, and
   `manifest.json`'s `start_url` (the installed "EdenAtlas" PWA icon still opens straight into the
   private Home, not the public Portfolio — auth-guard.js sends a signed-out tap through
   `login.html?redirect=home.html` same as any other protected page). `resume.html`'s and
   `project.html`'s "Back to Portfolio" links now point at the root (`index.html` / `index.html#work`)
   instead of the old `portfolio.html`, skipping the redirect hop.
4. **`login.html`'s redirect target is now an explicit allowlist**, not just a filename-shape
   regex — `getRedirectTarget()` only accepts one of the known private-page filenames (`home.html`
   and every other protected page), falling back to `home.html` for anything else, including a
   missing param or `index.html`/`portfolio.html`/`login.html` itself (deliberately excluded: the
   first two are the public Portfolio, never a "private destination"; the third would be a
   redirect-to-self loop). This closes the same class of open-redirect concern the old regex
   already mostly blocked (no protocol, no `//`, no slash), just via an allowlist instead of a
   shape check. A new small "Back to Portfolio" link (secondary, below the privacy line) was added
   to the login card, pointing at `index.html`.
5. **PWA**: `service-worker.js` `CACHE` → `eden-shell-v22`, `home.html` added to `PRECACHE`
   (`portfolio.html` stays precached too, now as the tiny redirect stub, so old offline-cached
   bookmarks still resolve). Online behavior unchanged (still network-first) — this only affects
   the offline-fallback path. No SPA-style navigation fallback exists in the service worker, so
   there was no risk of an index/portfolio redirect loop at the SW layer to begin with.
6. **SEO/social metadata** added to the new `index.html` only (canonical, Open Graph, Twitter
   Card, `robots: index, follow`) — `portfolio.html`'s redirect stub is `robots: noindex, follow`
   with its own canonical pointing at the root, so it's never indexed as separate/duplicate
   content. Canonical URL used: `https://eden-low.github.io/EJ-resume/` (as given for this pass) —
   note this **does not match** this repo's actual git remote (`eden-low/LFJ-resume`); confirm the
   real deployed GitHub Pages URL before relying on the canonical/OG tags, and update them if the
   repo is renamed or the Pages URL differs.
7. **Not part of this pass**: no Firebase Auth/rules/schema change, nothing deployed, pushed, or
   committed to git — this was a routing/markup-only change verified with static checks only (see
   the completion report handed to the user for the full test list); real two-browser QA
   (signed-out root load, login → intended destination, signed-in CTA, offline SW update) was not
   performed in this environment and is called out as a follow-up, same as prior passes' documented
   test limitations.

## Architecture

### Roles and the multi-tenant data model

- **Three roles, decided once at login and cached in `localStorage`** (`lfj:userMode` = `OWNER`/`FRIEND`/`VIEWER`, see [firebase-init.js](firebase-init.js)'s `getUserMode()`/`canParticipate()`): **Owner** (`jjun8647@gmail.com`, hardcoded) has full access everywhere and is the only role that sees admin UI (System Logs, Whitelist Management — now in Me's Connections/System Logs tabs, v2.7). **Friend** (an entry in `friends/{email}`, see below) gets their own space for Memories/Journal/Journey/Habits/Atlas/Collections/Calendar — structurally identical to the owner's for those modules, just their own `uid`. As of **v3.3**, Finance/Time Capsule/Daily Reflection are Owner-only regardless of Friend status (`firestore.rules`' `expenses`/`time_capsules`/`daily_reflections` `create` rules require `isOwner()`, not `canParticipate()`) — a Friend's own pre-v3.3 docs in those collections, if any, remain readable/editable, but no new ones can be created. **Viewer** (anyone else who signs in with Google) is read-only: sees public content from the owner and any friend, can like/comment on public gallery posts, but cannot create anything of their own (`canParticipate()` is false, so every "New X" button stays hidden and the Firestore rules would reject the write anyway). Nobody is ever signed out or blocked at login — this deliberately diverges from an earlier draft spec that wanted to bounce non-whitelisted users; the actual product decision is "let anyone in, public-only until promoted." **This role system is entirely separate from v3.2's peer-to-peer friend graph** (`friend_requests`/`friendships`, below) — role decides CRUD permissions and which profiles are even discoverable at all; the friend graph decides, independently, whether `visibility: "connections"` content is shown once a profile *is* reachable. `js/sidebar.js`/`js/mobile-nav.js` (v3.2) also read this same role to decide Owner-vs-Light navigation — see the Pages/Conventions bullets below.
- **The core query pattern, used identically across `gallery.js`, `journal.js`, `timeline.js`, `habits.js`**: two Firestore queries merged by doc ID — `where("uid","==",myUid)` (all of *my own* docs, any visibility) plus `where("visibility","==","public")` (everyone's public docs) — deduped into a `Map` keyed by `doc.id` so a doc that's both mine and public isn't double-counted. This replaced the old v1.2 "public query + private query" pattern, which relied on a blanket `where("visibility","==","private")` query that the new per-uid rules would reject outright (the rules engine can't confirm an unfiltered "give me all private docs" query only returns the caller's own — Firestore requires the query itself to be provably scoped). **`expenses` is the one exception**: it has no public/private concept at all anymore (financial data, always private), so `expenses.js`/`dashboard.js`/`export.js`/`calendar.js`/`insights.js` all just do a single `where("uid","==",myUid)` query with no public half.
- **Every write is gated by `canParticipate()`** (owner or friend) instead of the old `isOwner(user)` — `gallery.js`'s "New Post", `expenses.js`'s "Add Expense", `journal.js`'s "New Entry", `timeline.js`'s "New Event", and `habits.js`'s "New Habit" all switched from owner-only to participant-only. Every new doc is written with `uid: auth.currentUser.uid` (not a hardcoded owner reference), and per-post/per-item "is this mine" checks (e.g. gallery's Analytics-panel visibility, habits' check-in button) compare against `item.uid === auth.currentUser.uid`, not a global `isOwner()` call — ownership is now per-document, not site-wide.
- **[firestore.rules](firestore.rules)** defines the shared helpers `isOwner()`, `isFriend()` (checks `exists(friends/{email})` — the legacy whitelist-role check), `canParticipate()` (owner or friend — who may `create` in a participatory collection), and `isMineOrPublic(data)` (the read condition shared by `journals`/`life_events`/`habits`/`photos`/`collections`: `data.uid == request.auth.uid || data.visibility == 'public' || (data.visibility == 'connections' && isAcceptedFriend(data.uid))`, the last clause added in v3.2). `expenses`/`goals`/`time_capsules`/`daily_reflections` skip `isMineOrPublic` and just check `resource.data.uid == request.auth.uid` for read/update/delete, full stop — never touched by the `connections` tier. Their `create` rules differ since v3.3: `goals` stays `canParticipate()` (Owner or Friend), while `expenses`/`time_capsules`/`daily_reflections` require `isOwner()` — see the "EdenAtlas v3.3" history bullet above. `photos/{id}/likes`, `/comments`, `/views` reuse a `canReadPost(photoId)` helper (subcollection rules never inherit from the parent `match` block, so these need their own explicit blocks) — likes/comments are open to any signed-in user who can read the post (liking isn't "participating" in the personal-data sense), views stay create-only for the viewer and read-only for the post's own `uid`. `usernames/{username}` (new in v3.1) is a `create`-only, no-`update` collection — Firestore's create-vs-update distinction (a `create` rule only fires when no doc with that ID exists) makes "first writer claims the handle" fall out for free, no transaction or Cloud Function needed; its `read` rule is world-open (`if true`, since v3.2.2 — was auth-required), as is the new `public_profiles/{uid}` collection's, since neither ever holds anything sensitive (`public_profiles` is a denormalized `users/{uid}` mirror with `email` deliberately excluded) — both exist to let an unauthenticated `resume.html?u=...` visitor resolve a handle/owner-lookup without needing to read the auth-required, email-bearing `users/{uid}`. `career_experiences`/`career_projects`/`career_certificates`/`career_awards`' read rule is `isCareerReadable(data)` (v3.2.2): `data.visibility == 'public' || isMineOrPublic(data)` — the one place in this app where a `public` doc is readable with **no** `request.auth` requirement at all, since Career is the one collection meant to support an unauthenticated HR visitor. **`friend_requests/{toUid}/incoming/{fromUid}` and `friendships/{uid}/friends/{friendUid}`** (v3.2) back the mutual-consent friend graph — see the "EdenAtlas v3.2" history bullet above for the full rule shapes and why the accept flow needs no transaction; `isAcceptedFriend(ownerUid)` is the helper `isMineOrPublic()` calls, deliberately named apart from `isFriend()` to avoid shadowing the whitelist check. `notifications`' create rule has one narrow cross-uid exception for `friend_request`/`friend_accepted` types only (self-attested via `fromUid`).
- **[storage.rules](storage.rules)** mirrors this: paths are now `gallery/{uid}/{public,private,connections}/...` and `journal/{uid}/{public,private,connections}/...` (previously flat `gallery/{public,private}/...` with no per-user segment, and no `connections` tier before v3.2) so Storage can check `request.auth.uid == uid` directly from the path instead of needing a global owner check. A `canParticipate(email)` function cross-checks `firestore.exists(friends/{email})` (Storage rules can call into Firestore via the `firestore.*` namespace, as already used for the old `allowedUsers` check); the `connections` path's read rule additionally cross-checks `firestore.exists(friendships/{uid}/friends/{caller})`.
- **`friends/{email}`** (renamed from `allowedUsers`, doc ID = lowercase email — kept email-keyed rather than uid-keyed specifically so the owner can promote someone *before* they've ever signed in, when only their email is known) is managed from Me's Connections tab — Friend Management section (`me.js`'s `loadWhitelistManagement()`, moved from `settings.js` unchanged in v2.7), owner-only read/write, presence = approved (no separate `status` field; there's no self-serve request flow, so a `pending` state nothing else could ever set would be pointless).
- **`users/{uid}`** is a lightweight directory doc `{ uid, email, displayName, photoURL, role, username?, bio?, location?, createdAt }` upserted by `login.html` (with `{ merge: true }` — important, since a plain overwrite would blow away a `username`/`bio`/`location` set later from Me's Profile tab) on every successful sign-in, including session-restores (so a promotion/demotion shows up in `role` without needing a fresh interactive sign-in). Readable by any signed-in user, writable only by its own `uid`. `role` is `"owner"`/`"friend"`/`"viewer"` (lowercased from `getUserMode()`) — deliberately public, unlike the `friends` whitelist itself, so that any client can pre-filter Search People results without needing owner-only read access. `username` is optional, set from Me's Profile tab (`settings.js`'s original save flow, moved into `me.js` unchanged in v2.7), and uniqueness is enforced via a companion `usernames/{username}` reservation collection (doc ID = the handle, lowercase; the save flow does a `setDoc` create there first — which firestore.rules only allows when no doc with that ID exists yet — then deletes the old reservation and updates `users/{uid}`, so "claim if free" needs no backend). `bio`/`location` (added in v4.0) are free-text, also editable from Me's Profile tab, no uniqueness concern. `createdAt` (also v4.0) is a `serverTimestamp()` written **only the first time** `login.html`'s upsert sees no existing doc (checked via a `getDoc` first) — every later login's `merge: true` write omits it entirely, so it never resets; this is what `profile.html` formats as "Joined {month year}". This directory doc is what powers **dashboard.js's "Search People"**, **global-search.js**, and **profile.html** — see the Pages bullets below for all three. `careerVisibility` (v3.2.2, `"private"|"connections"|"public"`, missing == `"private"`) is the Owner-only page-level gate for `resume.html`'s public/friend viewer mode, set from a "Public Resume Link" control on `resume.html` itself (not Me) — see the "EdenAtlas v3.2.2" history bullet. Every field here except `email` is mirrored into the new, world-readable `public_profiles/{uid}` (below) so an unauthenticated resume visitor can resolve who they're looking at.
- **New collection `goals/{goalId}`** (v4.0): `{ uid, title, target, current, unit, deadline, createdAt }`. Always private — no `visibility` field, same read/write shape as `expenses` (owner-only read/update/delete, `canParticipate()` create) since personal targets have no public story. Managed entirely from Me's Overview tab (v2.7, moved from Dashboard unchanged), never a public/friend-visible collection.
- **New collection `collections/{id}`** (v2.7): `{ uid, title_en, title_zh, description_en, description_zh, coverImageUrl, icon, color, notes, visibility, createdAt, updatedAt }` — a life-chapter container, same `isMineOrPublic` read/write shape as `journals`/`life_events`/`habits`. Existing records reference it via an optional `collectionId` field (`null` on old, unmigrated docs) rather than being copied or moved; `photos`/`journals`/`life_events`/`expenses`/`career_projects` also gained optional `tags`/`locationName`/`latitude`/`longitude` fields (expenses: `collectionId`/`tags` only, no location, no visibility — still always-private). None of this needed a `firestore.rules`/`storage.rules` change beyond the one new `collections` match block, since this ruleset never restricts field sets via `hasOnly()`/`keys()`.

### Pages

- **No shared layout/include system.** Every protected page (`home.html`, `resume.html`, `gallery.html`, `atlas.html`, `journal.html`, `expenses.html`, `timeline.html`, `habits.html`, `calendar.html`, `reports.html`, `dashboard.html`, `notifications.html`, `contact.html`, `collections.html`, `collection-detail.html`, `me.html`, `settings.html`, `profile.html`, `time-capsule.html`) is a fully standalone HTML file that repeats the same `<head>` (Tailwind CDN, Font Awesome, `styles.css`, PWA manifest/theme-color/apple-touch-icon tags, a theme-preload inline `<script>` — see Light mode below) and the same header/nav markup (15 links plus an unread-notification badge next to "Notifications"). `login.html` is the one page that intentionally does **not** follow the shared nav/auth-guard pattern; `profile.html` follows it fully (auth-guard, full nav) but — like `login.html` — is deliberately *not* one of the linked pages, since it only makes sense with a `?uid=` param and is reached exclusively from a Search People result. **As of the "Portfolio to root" routing change, `index.html` is no longer one of these protected pages** — it's the public recruiter Portfolio (promoted from `portfolio.html`, which is now just a redirect stub) and deliberately carries none of the above (no auth-guard, no sidebar/mobile-nav, no theme-preload dependency on a signed-in user). The private Personal OS Home that used to live at `index.html` is now `home.html`, otherwise unchanged.
- **Site-wide login gate.** [auth-guard.js](auth-guard.js) is a shared ES module — every protected page loads it via a single `<script type="module" src="auth-guard.js"></script>` tag (right after `scripts.js`). It calls `onAuthStateChanged`; redirects to `login.html?redirect=<currentPage>` if signed out, otherwise removes the `auth-check-pending` body class to reveal the page. Forces a reload on a bfcache `pageshow` so Back-navigation re-checks auth. UX convenience only — real access control is `firestore.rules`/`storage.rules`. It also owns the one cross-page UI concern: if the signed-in user `isOwner` and the page's nav has a `#notif-badge` element, it queries `notifications` for `uid == owner && read == false` and lights up the badge.
- **Site-wide command palette.** [global-search.js](global-search.js) (v4.0) is the second shared ES module, loaded via `<script type="module" src="global-search.js"></script>` right after `auth-guard.js` on every protected page. Like `auth-guard.js`, it's self-contained — on `onAuthStateChanged`, it appends its own trigger button to `header nav` and its own modal to `document.body` rather than requiring any per-page markup, so wiring it up sitewide was a one-line-per-file addition. Opens on click or `Ctrl/Cmd-K`; queries `users` (role-gated like `dashboard.js`'s `searchableUsers()`), `photos`/`journals`/`life_events`/`habits` (mine+public merge), and `expenses` (mine-only, so other users' expenses are unreachable by construction of the query, not just by rules) and renders matches grouped by type with per-group counts.
- **[login.html](login.html)** is the one page every visitor can reach while signed out. On a successful `signInWithPopup`, it: (1) resolves the user's role via `resolveUserMode()` (owner check, then `getDoc(friends/{email})`) and caches it to `localStorage` as `lfj:userMode`; (2) upserts the `users/{uid}` directory doc; (3) writes a `login_logs` doc; (4) writes a `notifications` doc for *whoever just signed in* (no longer owner-only — everyone has their own notifications now). A `signingIn` flag guards against `onAuthStateChanged`'s own redirect firing mid-click and tearing down the page before these writes finish. On a session-restore (not a fresh click), `onAuthStateChanged` still refreshes the cached role before redirecting, in case whitelist status changed since the last visit. The `?redirect=` param is checked against an explicit allowlist of known private-page filenames (not just a shape regex, as of the "Portfolio to root" routing change) to prevent an open-redirect vector, falling back to `home.html` (was `index.html`, before that page became the public Portfolio) for anything missing or not in the allowlist — `index.html`/`portfolio.html`/`login.html` are deliberately excluded from the allowlist itself. On iPhone, an installed "Add to Home Screen" PWA can't reliably complete Google sign-in in its own standalone window (tried both `signInWithPopup` and `signInWithRedirect` — both strand the user on Google's page with no way back, most likely because the transient state Firebase Auth needs mid-flow doesn't survive the round trip through Google's origin inside a standalone WKWebView). The fix: `isStandalone()` (checks `matchMedia("(display-mode: standalone)")` / `navigator.standalone`) swaps the sign-in button for an "Open in Safari to Sign In" link (`target="_blank"`, which forces iOS to hand off to real Safari even from a standalone window); the user signs in there normally, then reopens the installed app, which picks up the persisted session via `browserLocalPersistence` without repeating sign-in.
- **[index.html](index.html)** is the public recruiter Portfolio (promoted from `portfolio.html` by the "Portfolio to root" routing change) — see the "EdenAtlas v3.5" history bullet above for its content/CMS-fallback design and the "Portfolio to root" history bullet for the routing mechanics; `[project.html](project.html)` (the case-study renderer) and `portfolio.js` are otherwise unchanged. **[home.html](home.html)** (content unchanged since v4.0, just moved off `index.html`) is a daily-habit landing page, not a dashboard — one inline `<script type="module">` block, still following this codebase's per-page duplication convention rather than importing other pages' `.js` files. Sections top to bottom: **Greeting** (time-of-day text + live clock + inline compact weather, reusing the old weather-widget fetch); **Today** (habits checklist, today's expense sum, did-I-journal-today, did-I-upload-today, unread notification count — all `where("uid","==",myUid)` only, no public merge, since this is a strictly personal landing page); **Memories** ("On This Day" — own photos/journals/life_events whose date matches today's month+day in a *different* year, grouped as "N years ago," hidden entirely if empty); **Recent Memories** (latest own photo/journal + 2 latest timeline events); **This Month** (expense total, habit completion %, journal count, photos uploaded); **Quick Actions** (canParticipate()-gated; three buttons open inline modals that `addDoc`/`uploadBytes` straight into `expenses`/`journals`/`photos` — not the full per-page forms, just the essential fields, then re-run the same data fetch to refresh Today/This Month/Memories immediately); and a slim single-row link list to every other page at the bottom (replacing the old 12-tile quick-link grid).
- **resume.html** combines 6 former pages into one — see section `id`s (`quests`, `events`, `experience`, `inventory`) which still carry old short names; don't rename without updating the sticky sub-nav anchors.
- **[gallery.js](gallery.js)** — Instagram-style feed. `fetchVisiblePosts()` uses the mine+public pattern (capturing `{ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }` — a v1.2 bug fix, previously plain `doc.data()` with no id). "New Post" is `canParticipate()`-gated, writes `uid: user.uid` and uploads to `gallery/{uid}/{visibility}/{category}/...`. Likes (`photos/{id}/likes/{uid}`, doc ID = liker's uid so "one like per user" is structural) and comments are open to any signed-in viewer who can read the post. The "Analytics" panel (total views / unique visitors / recent visitor emails) only renders on a post where `post.uid === auth.currentUser.uid` — per-post ownership, not a site-wide owner check. Views are recorded once per session for any viewer who isn't that post's own `uid`. The "someone liked your photo" notification (`checkLikeNotifications`) now fires per-post for whichever signed-in user owns that specific post, comparing against a `localStorage`-cached like count. **Albums (v4.0)**: `category` is now album taxonomy — `travel`/`projects`/`events`/`dailylife`, chosen from a select at upload time — plus an independent `featured: boolean` toggled per-post by its own owner (a heart/star control, just an `updateDoc` on the existing `photos/{id}` doc — already covered by the pre-existing owner-only update rule, no rules change). `albumOf(post)` maps a post's stored `category` through `LEGACY_CATEGORY_ALIAS` (`{personal: dailylife, event: events, work: projects, project: projects}`) so photos uploaded before this relabel still bucket correctly — existing Firestore data was never migrated, only the display/filter mapping changed. `profile.js` duplicates this same `CATEGORY_META`/`LEGACY_CATEGORY_ALIAS`/`albumOf` (per-page duplication convention, kept in sync manually).
- **[expenses.js](expenses.js)** — always-private, no visibility toggle in the UI or schema anymore. `fetchMyExpenses()` is a single `where("uid","==",myUid)` query (no public half). `checkExpenseAlert()` fires for *any* participant whose own month total crosses RM1000, deduped via `localStorage` per calendar month.
- **[journal.js](journal.js)** / **[timeline.js](timeline.js)** / **[habits.js](habits.js)** — all three use the mine+public pattern and `canParticipate()` write-gating described above. `journal.js`'s `checkJournalReminder()` and `habits.js`'s `checkStreakNotification()`/check-in button are scoped to the current user's own entries/habits (`entry.uid === user.uid` / `habit.uid === user.uid`), not a global owner check.
- **[dashboard.js](dashboard.js)** (nav-labeled **Connections** since v2.7, was People) — **Search People** (role-gated discovery, unchanged since v2.7: `loadUserDirectory()` fetches the `users` collection once; `searchableUsers()` role-filters it — a Viewer only ever sees `role === "owner"`, a Friend or the Owner sees `role === "owner" || "friend"` — before the free-text match against `displayName`/`username` runs, never `email`), plus, as of **v3.2**, the real friend graph: **Friend Requests** (incoming pending, Accept/Decline), **My Friends** (real accepted friendships, replacing the old "every role-visible person" list), and **Sent Requests** (pending requests I've sent, discovered by looping the cached `users` directory with one lazy `getDoc` per candidate — see the "EdenAtlas v3.2" history bullet for why this needs no new collection or collection-group query). `relationshipState(person)` picks one action per card (Add Friend / Pending / Accept+Decline / Friend badge + Remove Friend). `reconcileFriendships()`/`pruneStaleFriendships()`/`loadSentRequestsAndHeal()` self-heal both directions of the friendship mirror on every load, since the accept flow never does a cross-uid write (see below). The Gallery/Expense/Journal analytics, Goals, and Achievements that used to live here (v4.0) all moved to [me.js](me.js)'s Overview tab, unchanged, not duplicated.
- **[me.html](me.html) / [me.js](me.js)** (v2.7, replaces Settings + folds in Dashboard's personal-analytics half) — the personal control center, tabbed: **Overview** (Goals — a `#goals-section` hidden unless `canParticipate()`, progress bar/update/delete/"New Goal" modal, moved from `dashboard.js` unchanged; Achievements — `renderAchievements()`, tiered badges from live counts, same `ACHIEVEMENTS` defs and duplicated `computeStreak()` as before; Gallery/Expense/Journal analytics, Chart.js charts, all `fetchMyCollection(name)` = `where("uid","==",myUid)` only, no public merge); **Profile** (username reservation flow + bio/location, moved from `settings.js` unchanged); **Preferences** (theme/language/default city/default post visibility, moved from `settings.js` unchanged); **Privacy** (new, deliberately minimal — a role/visibility explainer plus a read-only echo of the Preferences default-visibility choice, no new toggles); **Connections** (Whitelist Friend Management, moved from `settings.js` unchanged, owner-only reveal); **Backup** (Export & Backup, unchanged `export.js` wiring); **System Logs** (last 20 `login_logs`, moved from `settings.js` unchanged, owner-only reveal). Tab switching is plain `classList.toggle("hidden")` on `.me-panel` divs, no routing.
- **[collections.html](collections.html) / [collections.js](collections.js)** and **[collection-detail.html](collection-detail.html) / [collection-detail.js](collection-detail.js)** (v2.7) — see the "EdenAtlas v2.7" history bullet above for the full design; reached only via a link inside `atlas.html`, no sidebar/drawer entry of its own.
- **[atlas.html](atlas.html) / [atlas.js](atlas.js)** (v2.7) — see the "EdenAtlas v2.7" history bullet above; the one page in the app that loads a non-Firebase third-party library (Leaflet.js + CARTO tiles, both CDN, no paid API).
- **[profile.html](profile.html) / [profile.js](profile.js)** — the read-only profile page Search People links to. `canViewProfile(targetRole)` re-derives the same Viewer-sees-only-Owner / Friend-and-Owner-see-each-other rule from `getUserMode()` + the target's `users/{uid}.role`, and is a **UI-level gate, not a firestore.rules change**: the underlying `isMineOrPublic`/`isPhotoMineOrPublic` read rules deliberately stay open to any signed-in user (that's what the main Gallery/Journal/Timeline/Habits feeds rely on to show everyone's public posts), so a determined client could still query a Friend's public docs directly — this page and Search People's list are the only things actually restricting discovery. If the gate fails, the page still renders the target's name/avatar/@username (fetched from the always-public `users/{uid}` doc) but shows a "This profile is private" notice instead of fetching any content. Otherwise it fetches public photos/journals/life_events/habits and renders (all v4.0, GitHub+Instagram-style): a header with **bio**/**location**/**joined date** (from `users/{uid}.createdAt`); a stat row including **habit completion %** (`habitCompletionPct()` — average, across the target's public habits, of `completedDates.length / daysSinceCreated`, clamped 0–100); a public **Achievements** row (`PUBLIC_ACHIEVEMENTS` — only Photos/Journal Entries/Longest Streak, deliberately *never* an expenses-based badge, since expenses are always private and unreadable for any uid but your own); a **Recent Activity** feed (public photos+journals+events merged and sorted by date); **Albums** (`album-tiles`, same `albumOf()`/`featured` taxonomy as `gallery.js`) that client-side-filter the existing photo grid (no extra query) with a "Back to all" reset; and compact **Public Timeline**/**Public Journal** lists. Clicking a grid thumbnail opens a modal that lazy-fetches that one photo's likes/comments and lets you like/comment on it (reusing `photos/{id}/likes|comments`, unchanged rules) — but there's no edit/delete affordance anywhere on the page, since this is someone else's content. **v3.2**: `fetchPublicFor()` became `fetchVisibleFor()` — still public-only for Habits, but for photos/journals/life_events it also merges in `visibility: "connections"` items (scoped `uid==target`) when a new `isAcceptedFriendOfTarget()` check (one `getDoc` on the target's own `friendships` subcollection) is true. `profile.html` deliberately **stays single-scroll** rather than being rebuilt into a tabbed Friend Profile View — only the data merge changed, not the page structure, a scope decision made explicitly to avoid a much larger rewrite.
- **[calendar.html](calendar.html) / [calendar.js](calendar.js)** (new in v2.0) — a 7-column month grid of the signed-in user's own expenses/photos/journal entries, bucketed by day. Fetches all of "my" docs per collection (no server-side date-range filter — an equality-plus-range query needs a composite index, so date bucketing happens client-side, consistent with this app's index-avoidance convention) and re-fetches on every month navigation via `Promise.all`.
- **[reports.html](reports.html) / [insights.js](insights.js)** (new in v2.0) — current-month stat cards (total spend, top category, photo/journal counts) plus two Chart.js charts (category doughnut, weekday-vs-weekend average bar) for the signed-in user's own data. The weekend-spending warning banner compares *average spend per elapsed day* in each bucket (not raw totals — a month always has more weekdays than weekend days, so raw totals would almost always favor weekdays).
- **[notifications.html](notifications.html) / [notifications.js](notifications.js)** — each user sees only *their own* notifications (`where("uid","==",user.uid)`, no `orderBy` — sorted client-side to avoid a composite index). Almost every notification is still self-written by whichever client observed the triggering condition (opening a general "write on someone else's behalf" surface wasn't worth it for a best-effort, non-realtime feature with no backend to push things instantly anyway) — **the one exception, added in v3.2, is `friend_request`/`friend_accepted`**, where the sender writes directly into the recipient's inbox (see `firestore.rules`' notifications create rule). `fetchNotifications()` and `auth-guard.js`'s badge query both used to gate on `isOwner(user)` — a pre-existing gap that predated v3.2 (the rules and `login.html`'s upsert already treated notifications as per-user) — v3.2 dropped that gate so non-owner recipients actually see their friend-request notifications.
- **[settings.html](settings.html)** — as of v2.7, a one-line `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=me.html">` compatibility redirect (added right after the charset meta, rest of the file left as-is) — everything it used to own (Profile, Preferences, Export & Backup, System Logs, Whitelist Management) lives in [me.html](me.html)/[me.js](me.js) now, see the Me bullet above. `settings.js` itself is unchanged and still script-tagged on `settings.html` (harmless — it runs briefly against `settings.html`'s still-intact markup before the meta-refresh navigates away) — kept in the repo as the historical source `me.js`'s logic was copied from, not as a parallel implementation to maintain going forward. [export.js](export.js)'s `fetchMyCollection(name)` still exports strictly "my own docs," never anyone else's public ones, unaffected by the move.
- **[images/](images/)** holds photo assets plus the PWA icons `icon-192.png`/`icon-512.png` (cropped from `me5.jpeg` via a one-off PowerShell/`System.Drawing` script — no build tool involved, just static files).
- **[firebase-init.js](firebase-init.js)** — shared Firebase bootstrap. Exports `auth`, `googleProvider`, `db`, `storage`, `OWNER_EMAIL`, `isOwner(user)`, plus the role helpers `USER_MODE_KEY`, `getUserMode()`, `canParticipate()` (read `lfj:userMode` from `localStorage` — UI gating only, real enforcement is always the Firestore/Storage rules re-checking `friends` fresh). Also calls `setPersistence(auth, browserLocalPersistence)` so sessions survive a PWA relaunch.
- **Deploying rules**: `npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules,storage` (project `lfj-profolio`, via [firebase.json](firebase.json)/[.firebaserc](.firebaserc)) after any `firestore.rules`/`storage.rules` edit. Dev-only tool, doesn't affect the site's buildless runtime.
- **PWA**: [manifest.json](manifest.json) + [service-worker.js](service-worker.js) (network-first with cache fallback; `CACHE` is version-stamped — bump it whenever `PRECACHE`'s file list changes, currently `eden-shell-v8`). Bypasses `gstatic.com`/`googleapis.com`/`firebaseapp.com`/`openweathermap.org`/CDN hosts so it never intercepts live Auth/Firestore/Storage/weather/CDN requests.
- **Light mode**: toggle in Me's Preferences tab (was Settings' Preferences pre-v2.7), stored in `localStorage` (`lfj:settings.theme`), applied via a synchronous theme-preload inline `<script>` at the top of every `<head>` plus `styles.css`'s `html[data-theme="light"]` overrides.

## Conventions to follow when editing

- **Nav links (v2.7: two live navs, one dead one)**: the original `<nav>` inside each page's `<header>` (15 non-login/non-profile pages as of v2.9: Home, Career, Memories, Atlas, Journey, Finance, Journal, Calendar, Connections, Reports, Inbox, Me, Habits, Time Capsule, Contact — `login.html` excluded, AI removed in v2.6, `profile.html` and `collections.html`/`collection-detail.html`/`me.html`/`atlas.html` are reached without ever being *in* this dead nav's link list, or in `collections.html`'s/`collection-detail.html`'s case have no dead-header nav block at all since they were built after the header was already retired) is now permanently inert — the `<header>` itself is `class="hidden"` on every breakpoint, superseded by `js/sidebar.js` (desktop) and `js/mobile-nav.js` (mobile). **When adding a new page, update three navs, not one**: `sidebar.js`'s `PRIMARY_LINKS`/`SECONDARY_LINKS`, `mobile-nav.js`'s `DRAWER_LINKS`, and (for completeness/history, even though it no longer renders) the dead `<header>` nav block, plus a quick-link card on `index.html` — unless, like Collections, the page deliberately has no sidebar/drawer entry of its own. The Notifications/Inbox link carries a `<span id="notif-badge">` in both the dead header nav and nowhere else — `auth-guard.js` looks it up by ID, and neither `sidebar.js` nor `mobile-nav.js` currently render an unread badge (a gap, not a deliberate omission — worth fixing if the badge matters going forward). When editing the *dead* header nav block identically across many files, a scripted find/replace (PowerShell loop matching the exact `<a href="...">` line text) beats manual edits — **always read the file back with explicit `-Encoding UTF8` (or `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText(path, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)`) on both read and write**. Windows PowerShell 5.1's `Get-Content`/`Set-Content` default to the system ANSI codepage when a file has no BOM, which silently mangles any existing non-ASCII character (em dashes, emoji) into mojibake (`â€”`, `ðŸ”¥`) that then gets baked into the file on write — this happened for real during the v2.0 pass and had to be cleaned up after the fact across several files.
- **Role-aware "Light EdenAtlas" navigation (v3.2)**: `js/sidebar.js`/`js/mobile-nav.js` now check `getUserMode()` and render a shorter flattened link list for any non-owner (Friend or Viewer), dropping Career/Finance/Reports/Time Capsule/Constellation — see the "EdenAtlas v3.2" history bullet. A page in that hidden set stays reachable by direct URL, backstopped by `auth-guard.js` redirecting non-owners away when the page's `<body>` carries `data-owner-only="true"` — add that attribute (not a new per-page check) when adding a future owner-only page.
- **New protected pages need three things**: the theme-preload inline `<script>` as the first line of `<head>`, the PWA `<link rel="manifest">`/`theme-color`/`apple-touch-icon` tags, `auth-check-pending` in the `<body class="...">` string, and `<script type="module" src="auth-guard.js"></script>` right after `scripts.js`. Copy an existing page (e.g. `timeline.html` or `habits.html`) as the template.
- **Color palette**: `darkBg`, `cardBg`, `borderNeon`, `neonPurple`, `neonBlue`, `neonViolet`, `textGray` — defined identically in each page's inline `tailwind.config`. No single source of truth; keep in sync manually.
- **Fonts**: `font-cyber` (headings/labels), `font-code` (monospace, data/labels), `font-sans` (body, default) — system stacks only.
- **Card style**: `bg-cardBg/90 backdrop-blur-sm p-6 rounded-2xl neon-border-purple`, often with `hover:-translate-y-1 transition-all` on clickable cards.
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6 solid icons, colored per section to visually distinguish categories.
- **Scroll reveal**: `reveal` class on top-level sections/cards; `reveal-group` on a shared parent for staggered children. Requires `<script src="scripts.js" defer></script>` before `</body>`.
- Copy the closest existing page as a starting template rather than writing one from scratch.
- **Copy tone**: professional "system profile" language — avoid RPG vocabulary (hunter, quest, guild, level/LV, EXP, inventory, loot tiers, dungeon). Prefer plain dashboard/resume terms.

## Keeping docs current

When adding a new page, section, or notable structural change, update both [README.md](README.md) (page table / tech stack) and this file so they stay accurate.
