// EdenAtlas Atlas Assistant — Owner-only, read-only Qwen-powered AI Function.
//
// Production route: /.netlify/functions/assistant (see netlify.toml — this file's *source*
// lives at netlify/functions/assistant.js, which is structurally excluded from the static
// publish output by scripts/build-site.js; only the deployed Function endpoint is reachable).
//
// This module intentionally never `require()`s any of this repo's browser ES modules
// (firebase-init.js, js/i18n.js, js/memory-filters.js, js/location-fields.js, etc.) — those use
// `export`/`import` syntax and are loaded by the browser as ES modules straight from source, but
// this Function runs under plain Node CommonJS with no "type":"module" declaration (see
// package.json's comment). Any small predicate this file needs from those modules (trashed-post
// filtering, coordinate validation) is duplicated locally in netlify/functions/lib/tools.js,
// matching this codebase's own established per-file duplication convention rather than inventing
// a new cross-runtime import mechanism for a handful of one-line functions.
//
// Security model (see docs/ai-architecture.md for the full design doc this implements):
//   1. The browser sends the current Firebase ID token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
//   2. This Function verifies that token server-side via Firebase Admin — the UID it acts on is
//      ALWAYS the one decoded from that verified token, never anything the request body claims.
//   3. It then re-reads `users/{uid}` via Firebase Admin (which bypasses firestore.rules
//      entirely) and requires `role === "owner"` AND the token's email to match the same
//      hardcoded OWNER_EMAIL constant firebase-init.js uses client-side — two independent
//      signals, so a stale/incorrect `role` field alone can never grant access.
//   4. Every Firestore read a tool performs is hardcoded to `where("uid","==",<verified uid>)`
//      against one fixed collection name — see lib/tools.js. The model never supplies a
//      collection name, document path, uid, or raw query operator.
//   5. No write path exists anywhere in this file or lib/tools.js. This is v1: read-only.
