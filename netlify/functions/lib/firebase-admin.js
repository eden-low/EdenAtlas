// Firebase Admin initialization boundary — deliberately separate from ID-token verification.
//
// Root cause #1 (first production incident): the previous version of
// netlify/functions/assistant.js called a lazy `getApp()` *inside* `verifyIdToken()`, and the
// handler wrapped that whole call in one try/catch that mapped ANY thrown error to
// `401 invalid_or_expired_token`. That meant malformed JSON, a missing service-account field, a
// mis-escaped private key, or `initializeApp()` itself throwing — none of which have anything to
// do with whether a given ID token is valid — all surfaced as "the token is invalid or expired."
// Fixed by giving initialization its own boundary (this file) with classified errors.
//
// Root cause #2 (second production incident, after root cause #1 was fixed): this file and
// netlify/functions/assistant.js were still written against firebase-admin's LEGACY namespace
// API (`require("firebase-admin")`, `admin.apps`, `admin.app()`, `admin.initializeApp()`,
// `admin.credential.cert()`, `admin.auth()`, `admin.firestore()`) while package.json installs
// firebase-admin ^14.2.0 — and v14 removed legacy namespace support entirely. Confirmed directly
// against the actual installed package (not assumed): `require("firebase-admin").apps` is
// `undefined` in v14, so the very first line of the old `initializeFirebaseAdmin()` —
// `if (admin.apps.length) return admin.app();` — threw a plain `TypeError` (no `.code`) reading
// `.length` off `undefined`, *before* any service-account parsing or validation ever ran. That
// TypeError propagated up uncaught by the `try/catch` around `initializeApp()` (which starts
// after that line) and was classified generically as `stage=admin_initialization code=no_code` —
// which is exactly what production logged. This file is now written entirely against v14's
// modular entry points (`firebase-admin/app`, `firebase-admin/auth`, `firebase-admin/firestore`)
// instead — see `initializeFirebaseAdmin()`'s parameters below, which take the specific modular
// functions (`getApps`, `getApp`, `initializeApp`, `cert`) as arguments rather than a legacy
// `admin` namespace object, so this module never touches a removed API again and stays testable
// (real modular functions from the installed package in production, injectable fakes in tests —
// see netlify/functions/__tests__/assistant.test.js's "real package" smoke test, which is what
// actually caught this class of bug: the old mock's fake `admin.apps` array papered over the
// real package's incompatibility).
//
// This module's only job is turning `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` + `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` into an
// initialized Admin app, failing with a *classified* error (one of the three stages below) when
// it can't — never silently, never disguised as a token-verification failure. It never calls
// `getAuth(app).verifyIdToken()` at all; that call happens only in assistant.js, after this
// module has already succeeded.
