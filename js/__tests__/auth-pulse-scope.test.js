// Regression test for a manual-QA bug found in Part 2 (Dark/Light audit): styles.css's
// `html::before` EA-mark loading watermark used to carry
// `animation: eden-auth-pulse 1.6s ease-in-out infinite` unconditionally, so it kept pulsing
// forever, not just during the brief auth-check window auth-guard.js actually needs it for. It's
// normally hidden behind opaque page content once auth resolves, but this app is full of
// deliberately translucent, blurred glass cards (bg-cardBg/90, backdrop-blur-sm, etc.) that let
// whatever's compositing behind them show through faintly -- so an infinite opacity animation on
// a full-viewport, always-dark layer (the Part 2 fix that made this backplate always-dark, not
// theme-switching) read as a continuous background flicker, worst in Light mode.
//
// PR #6 QA follow-up: the first fix only scoped the *animation* to
// `html:has(body.auth-check-pending)::before`, leaving a static `opacity: 0.55` on the resolved
// (post-auth) base rule -- which bled through the same translucent glass cards, just frozen
// instead of oscillating, and measurably degraded the effective contrast of light-gray text
// sitting on those cards (Portfolio/Profile hero supporting text, Home's date/weather line).
// The resolved state must be fully invisible (`opacity: 0`), not merely non-animating -- only
// `html:has(body.auth-check-pending)::before` may be visible at all, and only it may animate.
//
// This is a structural check on the real styles.css text (same convention
// home-recent-memories.test.js already uses for CSS assertions, since this repo has no CSS
// parser/computed-style test infrastructure), not a live-browser animation trace -- it proves
// the *shape* of the fix (resolved state is invisible; only the auth-pending state is visible
// and animates; reduced-motion still covers the conditional selector; the splash's own separate
// pulse is untouched) rather than sampling actual frame-by-frame opacity in a real renderer.
//
// Run with: node js/__tests__/auth-pulse-scope.test.js
