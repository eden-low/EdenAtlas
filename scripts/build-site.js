// EdenAtlas — deterministic allowlisted copy-to-publish build.
//
// Why this exists: netlify.toml used to publish the repo root directly (`publish = "."`) and
// rely on per-file 404-shadow redirects to block non-product files (firestore.rules, CLAUDE.md,
// tmp_*.ts, migrate-career.html, etc). Live testing after deploy found several of those
// redirects did not reliably block the file they targeted, and — worse — `publish = "."` also
// meant the Netlify Functions *source* directory (`netlify/functions/health.js`) was itself
// being served as a static file at `/netlify/functions/health.js`, a structurally different
// (and unintended) path from the real, separately-routed Function endpoint at
// `/.netlify/functions/health`.
//
// The fix here is structural, not another redirect: this script copies an explicit ALLOWLIST of
// files/directories — the actual product — into a generated `site/` directory, and
// `netlify.toml` points `publish` at that directory instead of the repo root. Anything not on
// the allowlist (internal docs, Firebase config, rules source, stray tracked files, the
// Functions source tree) is never copied, so it cannot be served no matter how Netlify's
// redirect engine behaves — there is nothing at that path to serve. `functions =
// "netlify/functions"` in netlify.toml is unaffected: Netlify reads Function source from the
// repo root independently of `publish`, so functions keep working with zero code changes.
//
// No dependencies, no bundler, no transpilation — every file is byte-identical to its source,
// preserving the exact same relative-path structure every page already depends on
// (styles.css/scripts.js/js/*/locales/*/images/* as siblings). This is Netlify's own
// documented `[build] command` pattern, not a new build framework.
//
// Run: `node scripts/build-site.js` (also what Netlify's own build step runs — see
// netlify.toml's `[build] command`).

// here on purpose.
