// Minimal network-first service worker for offline shell caching.
// Deliberately bypasses Firebase/CDN/weather hosts so it never interferes with
// the auth flow, live Firestore/Storage reads, or third-party API calls.
// v26 (trust/provenance pass): assistant.js changed again (server-generated evidence-row
// rendering — "Searched: ...", "Sources: ...", source count, and a "0 matching records" empty
// state, all built ONLY from the server's own non-model-controlled `provenance` object, never
// from the model's free text) and locales/en.json+zh-CN.json gained the new
// assistant.evidence_* keys these render with. netlify/functions/**/*.js also changed
// (lib/qwen.js's provenance tracker, lib/tools.js's list_calendar fix, assistant.js's system
// prompt) but, as with every prior Function-only change, isn't part of PRECACHE — Function
// source is never a static browser asset (see scripts/build-site.js's publish allowlist).
// v23 (Qwen Atlas Assistant MVP): adds assistant.html/assistant.js to PRECACHE (the new
// Owner-only page's static client shell — same treatment as every other page/script here).
// Bumped from v22 specifically because v22 was already deployed as its own separate release
// before this pass (per this pass's own instructions: only reuse a version stamp when there is
// evidence it was never shipped on its own) — this guarantees the new assistant.html/assistant.js
// entries actually get fetched into the offline cache on update, rather than an already-active
// v22 service worker never re-running its install step. Also fixes a real (if latent) gap: the
// fetch handler below used to only bypass *cross-origin* requests by host — but
// /.netlify/functions/* is SAME-origin (it's this site's own domain), so a Function response
// (health, and now the AI assistant) would previously have been written into the Cache Storage
// API on every call, regardless of the HTTP `Cache-Control: no-store` header netlify.toml already
// sends (Cache Storage doesn't auto-respect that header — only an explicit fetch-handler bypass
// does). AI answers and any other Function response must always be network-only. The Qwen/
// Alibaba Model Studio endpoint itself is never fetched by the browser at all (only server-side,
// from netlify/functions/assistant.js) — nothing here can ever intercept that call — this SW's
// existing cross-origin bypass (line below) already covers it if that ever changes.
// v25 (date-correctness, calendar-semantics, safe-output and source-navigation pass): several
// already-precached browser files changed and need to be re-fetched, not served stale —
// assistant.js (safe DOM-based rendering replacing innerHTML, source-chip deep links, New Chat
// reset), gallery.js/journal.js/timeline.js (new ?memory=/?entry=/?event= deep-link handlers),
// styles.css (the new .eden-deep-link-highlight rule), and locales/en.json+zh-CN.json (new
// assistant.* i18n keys). netlify/functions/**/*.js also changed but was never part of PRECACHE
// to begin with (Function source isn't a static browser asset — see scripts/build-site.js's
// publish allowlist, which structurally excludes netlify/ from the deployed site).
// v24 (Atlas Assistant production auth fix): assistant.js's frontend changed (the
// withOneRetryOn401 token-refresh-and-retry policy) and is precached below, so the cache is
// bumped again to guarantee that change is actually fetched rather than served from an
// already-active v23 worker's stale copy. netlify/functions/assistant.js and its lib/ modules
// also changed, but Function source was never part of PRECACHE to begin with (it isn't a static
// asset the browser fetches — see scripts/build-site.js's publish allowlist, which structurally
// excludes netlify/ from the deployed site entirely) — the bump here is solely for the one
// changed client asset.
// Earlier: v23 (Qwen Atlas Assistant MVP — assistant.html/assistant.js added to PRECACHE, and
// /.netlify/functions/* excluded from Cache Storage writes), v22 ("Portfolio to root" routing
// change — index.html is now the public recruiter Portfolio, home.html is the private app
// landing page), v21 (Trash privacy fix), v20 (Memory Trash + location-edit fix), v19 (canonical
// location pipeline fix).
