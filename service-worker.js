// Minimal network-first service worker for offline shell caching.
// Deliberately bypasses Firebase/CDN/weather hosts so it never interferes with
// the auth flow, live Firestore/Storage reads, or third-party API calls.
// v31 (Recent Memories invisible-click-target fix): home.html changed — memoryCard() (Home's
// "Recent Memories" widget) was assigning dynamically-created card anchors the `.reveal` class,
// but scripts.js's scroll-reveal IntersectionObserver only ever scans for `.reveal` elements
// once, at DOMContentLoaded, well before these Firestore-driven cards exist in the DOM. They
// were therefore never observed, so they stayed at `.reveal`'s base `opacity:0` permanently —
// fully clickable, correctly-routed anchors with no visible content, exactly matching this
// codebase's own documented convention (see gallery.js/journal.js/timeline.js/habits.js/
// expenses.js/notifications.js/collections.js/time-capsule.js) that any card appended after
// page load must use `is-visible`, never `reveal`. Pre-existing bug, not introduced by the v30
// Tailwind migration (byte-identical in the pre-migration commit) — bumped anyway because
// home.html is a precached asset and this fix must reach an already-installed worker.
// v30 (Tailwind local build migration): the runtime Tailwind Play CDN (cdn.tailwindcss.com) is
// replaced by a pinned local Tailwind v3.4.19 build — every page's `<script
// src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com">` and inline `tailwind.config = {...}` block is gone,
// replaced by one `<link rel="stylesheet" href="tailwind.generated.css">` reading tokens from
// the new root-level tailwind.config.js (single source of truth, byte-identical values to what
// every page's inline config used to duplicate). tailwind.generated.css is a new same-origin,
// build-time-generated asset (never hand-edited, gitignored) and is added to PRECACHE below.
// cdn.tailwindcss.com is removed from BYPASS_HOSTS — the runtime dependency on that host no
// longer exists, so there is nothing left for this worker to bypass there; every other bypass
// host/path and cache rule is unchanged.
// v29 (Production Hardening Phase 1): home.html/me.js changed — the hardcoded, browser-exposed
// OpenWeatherMap API key is gone from both; weather now goes through a new authenticated Netlify
// Function (netlify/functions/weather.js, never part of PRECACHE — Function source is never a
// static browser asset, same as every other Function in this repo) via a new shared browser
// module, js/weather-client.js (added to PRECACHE below). Two more new shared browser modules
// also added: js/date-utils.js (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur-aware date-key helper) and js/reflection.js
// (Daily Reflection's save-payload/query-key logic) — both power home.html's fix for a real
// permission-denied bug on a day with no reflection yet (a direct getDoc()-by-ID against a rule
// that checks resource.data.uid throws when the document doesn't exist; replaced with a
// rules-provable where("uid",...)+where("dateKey",...) query) and a fix so editing an existing
// reflection no longer re-stamps its createdAt. calendar.js also changed (escaping a stored
// journal title before it's interpolated into the day grid's innerHTML — a defensive fix, not a
// behavior change); it's already in PRECACHE below, so this bump is what makes that fix actually
// reach an already-installed worker instead of being served stale from cache.
// v28 (strict collection-scope consent fix): assistant.html/assistant.js changed again — a new
// "Calendar also needs Memories and/or Journal selected" notice (and matching Send-disable) now
// fires whenever Calendar is checked without Memories or Journal, since Calendar is a
// date-organizing capability, never a data grant of its own (the actual bug this pass fixes was
// server-side — list_calendar used to always read BOTH Memories and Journal whenever Calendar
// alone was enabled, regardless of which of those two the Owner had actually checked — see
// netlify/functions/lib/tools.js/qwen.js, which aren't part of PRECACHE) — plus a new calendar
// scope hint line clarifying what Calendar actually does. locales/en.json+zh-CN.json gained the
// new assistant.scope_calendar_hint/calendar_needs_source_notice keys these render with.
// v27 (scope-change conversation isolation pass): assistant.js changed again (any scope checkbox
// change now aborts the in-flight request, clears the conversation + sessionStorage, and shows an
// accessible "Data access changed. A new chat was started." notice; zero scopes selected disables
// Send with a "Select at least one data source..." notice instead of ever calling Qwen) and
// locales/en.json+zh-CN.json gained the new assistant.scope_change_notice/select_scope_notice
// keys these render with. netlify/functions/assistant.js's system prompt also changed (scope
// authority instruction) but Function source was never part of PRECACHE (see prior entries).
// v26 (trust/provenance pass): assistant.js changed again (server-generated evidence-row
// rendering — "Searched: ...", "Sources: ...", source count, and a "0 matching records" empty
// state, all built ONLY from the server's own non-model-controlled `provenance` object, never
// from the model's free text) and locales/en.json+zh-CN.json gained the new
// assistant.evidence_* keys these render with. netlify/functions/**/*.js also changed
// (lib/qwen.js's provenance tracker, lib/tools.js's list_calendar fix, assistant.js's system
// prompt) but, as with every prior Function-only change, isn't part of PRECACHE — Function
// source is never a static browser asset (see scripts/build-site.js's publish allowlist).
// v23 (Qwen Atlas Assistant MVP): adds assistant.html/assistant.js to PRECACHE (the new
// Owner-only page's static client shell — same treatment as every other page/script here).
// Bumped from v22 specifically because v22 was already deployed as its own separate release
// before this pass (per this pass's own instructions: only reuse a version stamp when there is
// evidence it was never shipped on its own) — this guarantees the new assistant.html/assistant.js
// entries actually get fetched into the offline cache on update, rather than an already-active
// v22 service worker never re-running its install step. Also fixes a real (if latent) gap: the
// fetch handler below used to only bypass *cross-origin* requests by host — but
// /.netlify/functions/* is SAME-origin (it's this site's own domain), so a Function response
// (health, and now the AI assistant) would previously have been written into the Cache Storage
// API on every call, regardless of the HTTP `Cache-Control: no-store` header netlify.toml already
// sends (Cache Storage doesn't auto-respect that header — only an explicit fetch-handler bypass
// does). AI answers and any other Function response must always be network-only. The Qwen/
// Alibaba Model Studio endpoint itself is never fetched by the browser at all (only server-side,
// from netlify/functions/assistant.js) — nothing here can ever intercept that call — this SW's
// existing cross-origin bypass (line below) already covers it if that ever changes.
// v25 (date-correctness, calendar-semantics, safe-output and source-navigation pass): several
// already-precached browser files changed and need to be re-fetched, not served stale —
// assistant.js (safe DOM-based rendering replacing innerHTML, source-chip deep links, New Chat
// reset), gallery.js/journal.js/timeline.js (new ?memory=/?entry=/?event= deep-link handlers),
// styles.css (the new .eden-deep-link-highlight rule), and locales/en.json+zh-CN.json (new
// assistant.* i18n keys). netlify/functions/**/*.js also changed but was never part of PRECACHE
// to begin with (Function source isn't a static browser asset — see scripts/build-site.js's
// publish allowlist, which structurally excludes netlify/ from the deployed site).
// v24 (Atlas Assistant production auth fix): assistant.js's frontend changed (the
// withOneRetryOn401 token-refresh-and-retry policy) and is precached below, so the cache is
// bumped again to guarantee that change is actually fetched rather than served from an
// already-active v23 worker's stale copy. netlify/functions/assistant.js and its lib/ modules
// also changed, but Function source was never part of PRECACHE to begin with (it isn't a static
// asset the browser fetches — see scripts/build-site.js's publish allowlist, which structurally
// excludes netlify/ from the deployed site entirely) — the bump here is solely for the one
// changed client asset.
// Earlier: v23 (Qwen Atlas Assistant MVP — assistant.html/assistant.js added to PRECACHE, and
// /.netlify/functions/* excluded from Cache Storage writes), v22 ("Portfolio to root" routing
// change — index.html is now the public recruiter Portfolio, home.html is the private app
// landing page), v21 (Trash privacy fix), v20 (Memory Trash + location-edit fix), v19 (canonical
// location pipeline fix).
